"3","Mental Health Check:

Weve all heard the big win stories, how everyone bought very low and sold high etc. But I feel majority of this sub is losing and being quiet about it.

Use this thread to Vent:

Im a student and Im down 6k and Im lost for words and no idea if itll recover

No bashing please"
"4","Title  says it. I am a US citizen living in the UK, looking to get into  algorithmic trading. Low trading fees are necessary, since I am not  going to make a large profit per trade. A well-documented API is also  necessary for obvious reasons.

The  twist comes in with the UK versus US part. Since I am residing in the  UK, I am able to make up to Â£12k per year tax free. My understanding is  that if I use an exchange based in the US, I would be looking at \~40%  capital gains tax since I am not planning on long-term positions.

So,  are there any UK exchanges with fees comparable to Binance (for  example) at 0.1% buy/sell rate that allow US citizens to trade?"
"5","I've been using Block Fi for the better part of a year now as a way to accrue some passive bitcoin through interest. However, I've noticed that the amount of interest will change throughout the month. Most noticeably this month. I had roughly $55 in ""paid interest"" but when I logged in today to see May's payout I was irritated to see that it now says $44 has been paid. Does BlockFi adjust the paid interest based on BTC current value or are they just straight up taking money back? The longer I've been with BlockFi the more I feel they are a sketchy company, but I'm not selling my BTC at such an extreme loss so I guess I'm stuck with them til condition improve. Thanks for any info ya'll might have!"
"6","We all know how unsafe credit card payments can be sometimes if you entrust the wrong party with it.

There have been countless incidents where people who didnt know any better had their funds drained by a malicious website after entrusting it with their card.

Crypto payments on the other hand can never face this problem. You account can never be compromised the way a bank account can.

Also, these crypto payments services are becoming faster and cheaper by the day to the point where some crypto payment services like e-money offer lightning fast transactions are near zero fees.

This is the kind of convenience that will drive people to slowly but surely end up adopting crypto payments in order to secure and more private and assure themselves a method of payment without ever having to worry about the account being undermined."
"7","Do Kwon's Terraform Labs reportedly working on a new decentralized stablecoin built on Terra 2.0. Investors lost billions of dollars when Terraforms algorithmic stablecoin, UST, broke its 1:1 peg to the US dollar. 

Will you buy the new stablecoin when its launched?"
"8","Why is Bitcoin the number one? I always read something like dont invest in altcoins/shitcoins just bitcoin but what makes it so safe? I mean if its the supply or decentralization there is litecoin or even better monero who is anonym. So what is the point of bitcoin, just the fact that its the first crypto?

The Luna crash let me thought about if the same can happen to bitcoin (not the same way but no more trust and everybody selling) and i dont find the answer."
"9","Bitcoin BTC is trading above $31,000 for the first time in 2 weeks. Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, has rallied 6.6% so far this week after reaching a low of $25,401 last week. 

Do you think Bitcoin has bottomed or is the bear market not over yet?"

**According to the article**, **Russia's central bank official says they don't object to the use of crypto in international transactions. The US &amp; its allies imposed economic sanctions on Russia after its Ukraine invasion.** 

**Do you think the use of crypto by Russia might lead to outright bans on crypto by the US?**"

Billionaire investor, Tim Draper, predicts Bitcoin BTC will reach $250,000 by the end of 2022 or early 2023. Bitcoin is trading at $31,902 as of this writing, 53.6% down from its all time high.

Do you think Draper's prediction is possible?

If not, comment your BTC prediction by the end of 2022"

I am not a newbie in crypto, but somehow never paid much attention to healthcare going to the Blockchain. Honestly, it was quite surprising for me to see how far things have gone in this direction.  
Dapps are rewarding you with tokens for walking, running, cycling, and other sporty activities. HealthBlocks is aiming even higher, and also rewards you for sleep, mental health, diet, etc.  When someone joked and posted what's next sleep to earn? I honestly didn't expect it to be a thing. Incredible! 
Just like that, no more issues with data protection, sharing, and health management. 
Interesting times are coming! Love the Blockchain!"
"13","I'm somewhat new to crypto, I have a couple wallets (Metamask, Loopring) and a few coins (LRC,IMX, AMP, ETH) that I've picked up asking the way, but I'd like to learn how to look for investment opportunities; short or long term.

So, what was the process you used to pick your investment?"
"14","The otherside mint taught me and many others a few lessons; Ethereum is not ready for mass adoption, L2 rollups are the only thing helping it survive and people are sick of paying their kidneys in fees for the sake of good security. Good security should never cost this much, if it does, it means that your World Computer needs upgrades. And every singe upgrade needs 8 years of purity testing to go forward, and its not like Ethereum will get cheaper with the merge. 

This has led many people, even Yuga Labs who dropped the otherside mint on ETH, to consider other chains, chains that will not break when youre minting a 100,000 NFTs all at once. How do we fix this? We explore better alternatives until Ethereum catches up, and if it doesnt, well just congratulate it on the good run. Ive been exploring AVAX since it launched, LUNA till it crashed, Polygon, and now Cartesi as theyve literally built a blockchain OS on Linux VM. 

its super fun to see where crypto is heading, everyone is exploring literally every single coding language to build the perfect chain. This is great, it brings more people to the space, more institutional money for big firms that missed out on ETH, and will be a great catalyst to kicking off the bull market sooner than ever."
"15","We keep hearing horror stories of people losing large sums of money investing in Terra Luna. Some of those people were early investors who believed in the project and couldn't possibly foresee what was about to happen. But what we're not hearing a lot about are the people who invested in Terra while it was collapsing. To be honest, I almost became one of them. When the price of Terra fell below $10, I was seriously thinking about throwing a grand into it in hopes that some miracle would happen and the price would go back up. But then I looked closely at the supply and realized that this was not the same Terra that was valued at over $100 per coin. At the time, the supply was approaching 1 billion. Now there are over 6 trillion in circulation. Even if I had waited until the price fell to one cent, I would have lost that entire grand. I'm sure there are some people on here who made that mistake and are now regretting it. So, let's hear your stories!"

Im done with Coinbase but what are some other good wallets that allow direct withdrawals into your linked bank account?"
"17","Anything related to Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg in anyway possible shouldnt come anywhere near the crypto market.

This market is very sensitive when it comes to privacy and identity preservation and anything that would compromise that maliciously is VERY unwelcomed.

Knowing the past behind Faceboon and its ways of acquiring private information without consent, I wouldnt want it anywhere near this market.

I know this might sounds like a reach but it always starts out slow with companies like this one, and slowly but surely theyll end up with basically all our private info and activity."
"18","What chain do you think will be leading market in gamification, transactional speed and scalability?"
