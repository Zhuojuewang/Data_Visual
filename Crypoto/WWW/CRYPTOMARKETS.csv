Here's what he has to say...

""I think blockchains great. But lets call it a digital gold. I think a digital gold, which would be a bitcoin kind of thing, is something that  probably in the interest of diversification of finding an alternative to gold  has a little spot relative to gold and then relative to other assets."""
"10","The amount of ETH staked in the Beacon Chain smart contract has reached 12.76 million according to Glassnode. It reported that 398,000 unique validators have staked and an additional 19,800 staked and came online in May. 

Glassnode also claims that the amount of staked ETH is 10.73% of the circulating supply. At current prices, the value of those locked up assets is around $23.3 billion.

Other sources vary slightly with the Ethereum Launchpad dashboard reporting 13.36 million ETH staked, which works out at 11% of the total supply.

Either way, the increase in staking and validating is a vote of confidence for the Ethereum ecosystem in a bear market that is mired in negative sentiment and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) at the moment.

The Merge effect

The highly anticipated Ethereum Merge is set to take place in Aug, however it has some industry onlookers concerned. The Merge will end proof-of-work mining and transition the network to proof-of-stake reducing its energy consumption by more than 99%.

Many in the crypto community seem to think that all of this staked ETH will be sold to markets once the Merge takes place. This is unlikely to occur for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the staked assets will not be immediately released when the Merge takes place as it is needed to secure the network and guarantee consensus. Secondly, the ETH will be released in tranches and not all at once so it will trickle back into markets rather than flood them.

From a price perspective, fundamentals are not usually factored in during bear market conditions so it is unlikely that ETH prices will surge when the Merge takes place. Some industry experts are of the opinion that the Merge will be bullish for Ethereum prices, but only time will tell.

That is the goal of the MINE token. To have a life altering impact on you as holders. It might be as small as funding that cup of coffee on the way to work each morning, to purchasing that dream house or even more! Only you can know what you can afford to invest.  Please invest wisely and only what you are comfortable losing as investments of any kind carry risk. Dream big when you get into MINE, because we are! We have lofty goals and want to share those rewards with those who have supported us as we take this journey. 

Right now you can get in super early at very low price. Investing in MINE is like putting money into a retirement account. It may go up and down along the way but you know at the end of the day it's the right way for future income. Not to mention the ETH reflections you gain by holding. The reflections are like dividends. They are
based on 6% of the trading volume which is equally distributed among every holder. Personal experience has already shown me it beats any interest rate you recieve from the bank. 

Not only does MINE use the development for buying mining equipment to mine its own eth, which creates a far larger ROI it combines it with 6% eth reflections. 100% of the mined eth goes towards buybacks feeding into the holders at the same time it's increasing the scarcity and eventually building towards becoming hyper deflationary.

"14","Description:    
Linu is an ERC20 token project to promote decentralization and philanthropy using memes

What Is Linu (LINU)?    

Linu is a decentralized and community-run ERC20 token project designed to promote decentralized decision making and philanthropy, using memes as marketing tools. Linu is a grassroots project that went to #1 trending on Dextools within a week of launch and over $12 million USD marketcap within the first 2 weeks. It is listed on CoinGecko, and has been featured in numerous press releases such as on Yahoo Finance, Marketwatch and BitcoinInsider. Within a 2 week span, Linu has gained over 1800 token holders and over 6000 social media followers.    
 
LINU is the native utility token that is used for:    

-Philanthropic efforts for victims of crypto scams.   
-Funding projects that promote decentralization.   
-Prizes for creative meme contests.   

The Linu token contract code is a 1:1 clone of Shiba Inu. The contract is renounced, there is zero percent tax on trades, and the initial liquidity is locked for 100 years.    

Two professional code audit firms, Tech Audit and Tech Rate, have audited the token contract code, and the code successfully passed both audits without significant issues identified.    

How Many LINU Coins Are There in Circulation?    

LINU launched its token on May 15, 2022 with 1,000,000,000,000,000 LINU tokens created at genesis. There were 250.8 trillion tokens burned initially. The circulating token supply is fixed and stable at 749,167,374,404,513 tokens. Besides the tokens in the Uniswap liquidity pool, the remaining token holders are community holders.    

Who Are the Founders of LINU?    

An anonymous developer created LINU, and left the project early after its inception. The founders disappearance initially threatened the projects future existence, but the community quickly organized new infrastructure and leadership. The community aligned itself and established an official updated website, telegram, twitter, reddit, and email address. All of these links have been updated correctly on Etherscan.io, Dextools.io, and CoinGecko.    

The current core community leadership team are 14 people from across the world. One of the leads has verified his identity via KYC through the StaySafu verification service.    

Where Can I Buy LINU?    
 
LINU is currently traded on Uniswap V2.    
 
What Makes Linu Unique?    
 
Linu is 100% community owned and run. The community makes decisions and executes strategies in a decentralized fashion. The token contract is renounced and the initial liquidity is locked for 100 years, minimizing the risk of bad actors controlling the code or removing liquidity.    

Linus objectives are to help victims of crypto scams, raise funds in a decentralized manner using crowdfunding and NFTs, and promote a model of conducting business in a decentralized manner. Linu aims to become an example to the non-crypto world of the benefits of decentralization in terms of efficiency, inclusivity, and fairness in business.    

The Linu community uses memes, a powerful and viral form of communication, to market the project and to form partnerships with other projects that are aligned with the vision of decentralized business."

Because blockchain tech with it's sustainability and ability to improve any sector can bring about change by bringing a piece of the modern world to our globes most remote parts.

"18","By Marcel Kasumovich, Head of Research at One River Digital, dated 5/12/2022

The issue is what happens in bankruptcy. Forget about the fact that Coinbase has more than $6 billion in cash and less than $4 billion in debt without a principal risk trading business. Bankruptcy risk is remote to non-existent. The attention over the new disclosure, a requirement of SAB 121, was amplified by the downturn in digital assets and the downfall of Terra. The uneven nature of the application of regulation is the problem, not the security of on-chain assets. It is an important issue for institutional adoption.

The Coinbase 10Q reports $256 billion of assets in its platform in the first quarter and a total balance sheet of $21 billion. Roughly $10 billion are custodial funds owed to customers, a small share of the $256 total assets. This is not unusual. State Street Corp. reports $41.7 trillion in assets under custody and $4.0 trillion of assets under management with a gross balance sheet of $322 billion. They are not 142 -times leveraged (45.7/0.322). The $45.7 trillion is the asset of the individuals and institutions using State Street services. If State Street were bankrupt, creditors would not have a claim on customer assets. Clearly.

Digital is no different. All Coinbase customer assets are separately legered, and vaulted assets are uniquely identified by a wallet. That wallet is the digital, on-chain representation of ownership. There is no confusion and precisely no uncertainty about that ownership. Lets imagine the black-swan event of Coinbase being bankrupt. Would a bankruptcy court allocate assets with known ownership to a pool of general creditors? It is nothing short of absurd to think the answer to this question is in doubt. The answer is NO (emphasis mine)."

"22","Bitcoin, the dominion of crypto market since 2009, experienced a 9-week price decrease started in April, 2022, nevertheless it looks like will continue to head down to the south over the next few weeks. While it is still under debate whether equity assets have entered into bear market, almost every crypto participants, including the most radical faith believer, would agree the crypto winter has arrived.

As a normal guy who has no ability in foreknowledge, I would rather not join others to vision where the future price holds, but at least for now we are in a proper position where we can recap what happened this year:

1. The fear of skyrocketed inflation has changed Feds tune to hawkishness, with accelerated pace of rising Fed rate and an aggressive runoff plan effective June 1.
2. The rise of interest rate leveled the risk-free rate, making conservative assets more attractive, which could be supported by the observation of funds outflow from risky assets (cryptos, meme stocks, etc.) to Bonds, T-Notes and some other fixed-income instruments.
3. Bitcoin has shown an increasingly positive correlation with S&amp;P 500 since 2021, which was expressed to be a sign of similarity in terms of asset class.
4. The miserable Luna Crash exacerbated the downside of crypto market, remarked as the largest Layer-1 failure which wiped out 2.7% of total crypto market. Meanwhile over 52,000 BTC were transferred to exchanges, a sign of capitulation or impulsive sell-off.

Interestingly, every 4 or 5 years there would be a systematic failure on crypto market as a whole. In 2013 it was the bank run on Mt. Gox, dragging BTC price down by over 50%. 2017 reminds me of notorious ICO, deception of selling shit coins coming from nowhere which hammered the market down by 80%. It is a fact that Bitcoin has been a new-age investing asset since its birth, and we definitely were, and will be paying for the role of child caring. See link: [7 of the Biggest Bitcoin Crashes in History](https://www.yahoo.com/video/7-biggest-bitcoin-crashes-history-180038282.html)

No matter what faiths you believe in, or what you expect Bitcoin to become of, remember as follows:

1. Its nature of high volatility will not vanish but enhanced by more participants and a perception of correlation with major equity markets
2. There is a long way to the fulfillment of BTC as a globally mainstream payment method, both technically and mentally. Pseudoanonymity still opens for being improved, massive commercial adoptions have not arrived yet, an overweight on scarcity provided a fixed supply somehow dispelled the willingness to use BTC as a medium of exchange, as a currency.
3. Bitcoin will always move in a binary tree over the course of development, either be the global digital currency or be a charming, fancy tool for value storage, I am afraid it can not be both.

To all hoarders, including myself: bear in mind that studies found all mankind have a long historical record of hoarding disorder, often result in many kinds of catastrophe. One thing is to be a faith believer, another thing is to be a flaw man but with self-awareness."

Such applications have very low entry barriers: no previous cryptocurrency experience is required to start earning passive income with Move-to-Earn.

Technically, Move-to-Earn is all about microtransactions. In the segment, dApps need to send their users thousands of small transactions in a lightning-fast manner to ensure fair, inclusive and democratic participation.

**SocialFi**

What [DeFis](https://getblock.io/blog/decentralized-finances-def-explained-shortest-manual-you-will-ever-find/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) made for banks, SocialFi applications are going to make for social media platforms. Through a set of blockchain-based instruments, SocialFi apps allow users to monetize their content, interact with each other, and earn crypto through marketing integrations.

Also, SocialFi applications are going to address major censorship and centralization issues that plagued Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

Just like Move-to-Earn protocols, SocialFi apps prioritize microtransactions: they serve as a crypto-backed analogs of likes and upvotes. Also, SocialFi apps should be flexible and adjustable.

"34","Everyone appeared to agree on one thing: the state of the globe is worsening.   
 

Money, or the lack thereof, is one of the world's most severe vices for people who aren't millionaires.   
 

I used to hate money and would whine about how unfair the system was. I was fed up with living in poverty and decided to go out on my own. It amounted to little more than my remarkable aptitude in fields where no one else was interested.   
 

All of this is to say that discovering how much I dislike fiat was completely coincidental. Money isn't always viewed as a bad thing. Having a viable trading approach is useful, with the emphasis on the term viable.   
 

I'm simply thankful to be in a world where BTC, ETH, CoinFantasy, and other cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy, allowing us to put them to good use and improve everyone's quality of life on the planet."

Unlike traditional shops, we won't charge per hour or per project, but on a fixed monthly basis starting at $799/mo with unlimited design requests and revisions.

This is my humble attempt to narrow the chams between the wisdom of the recent past and the speed of the future. Helping founders build web3 products that are useful and unique. That are beautiful and usable. And that brings new perspectives, but never at the expense of greater surface complexity.

My question is, how would L2s and scaling solutions react?  
A large number of the top 20 coins on the market are L2s and scaling solutions like Polkadot, Polygon, Avalanche aside from the many other scaling solutions that fall below the top 20 list.

All of these projects would technology be rendered obsolete if an L1 solved the trilemma and will slowly fade into obscurity. So Im pretty sure they wont go without a fight.

There are some L1s that are pretty close to solving the trilemma right now most prominent of which would be Cardano but their ecosystem is a bit dry right now and could use some more development. Another one would be Hedera especially now that Hbar foundation is allocating hundreds of million if dollars to allegedly make Hedera the most well rounded and capable L1 on the market.

I dont know how long it will take for an L1 to prove itself capable of solving the trilemma but Im pretty sure we arent too far away from that day.

Hello,

I'm a developer and a stock trader. I used many forms of journals to try and make sense of my trading habits (good or bad) but most made data entry a pain or just overall clunky to use. So I built my own trading journal that represents my needs and workflow. The goal is to create a trading journal that has a friendly UI, fast and **FREE** for most use cases.

I had great response and feedback from my ALPHA build and would like to continue expanding the feature set with your help.

Currently, the journal is in **BETA** and I would love to hear feedback from the community to expand on features or fix any issues that are still lingering.

*Some of the current features are as follows:*

* Simple manual trade entry
* Trade setup
* Convert setup to a trade
* Notes
* Tags
* Statistics
* Trade calendar with day PnL
* User settings with defaults for a even simpler entry process
* Image attachments
* Account balance tracking

Thank You

**Q&amp;A**

* ***Is it free?***  

   * YES. While I can't promise that all future features will be free, the goal is to provide a free trading journal that has enough features to satisfy most people. All functionality in BETA should continue to stay free.
* ***How is this different from TraderSync or TraderVue?***  

   * Both those products are great but StonkJournal is tailored differently. The UI and functionality revolves around quickness, short learning curve and an overall journaling flow that if compared is quite different then the rest. While StonkJournal also has a dark theme like some of the other journals, the similarities mostly stop there. Trying it out is the best way to understand the differences and to see if it works for you.
* ***Whats with the name?***  

   * First and foremost I am not married to the name. However; it was mostly born out of humar, and while StonkJournal is a legitimate stock journaling application I found humor in naming it StonkJournal because the two words Stonk &amp; Journal should NOT go hand in hand. Basically what Im saying is don't take the name itself too seriously but also don't get attached for I might change it later :)."

Over the course of the past year, the Spell token has surprised us with a powerful rise of more than 800%. However, earlier in 2022, it experienced rough times.

The Spells price has fallen more than 74% in the previous month. The reason for that became a concern connected with the founding boards  the investors have closed multiple major positions on the Spell token and the MIM (Magic Internet Money) stablecoin that are included in the overall ecosystem.

He recently proposed a Terra blockchain hardfork, which requires creating a new copy of the network with significant upgrades. The new blockchain will be absent of the algorithmic stablecoin and will feature a billion Luna tokens, which will be issued to current Luna and UST holders and used to encourage the development of new Terra apps.

I'll link it [here](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/algorithmic-stablecoins-what-they-are-and-how-they-can-go-terribly-wrong/).  


They lost a lot of money in the crisis, which exposed the weakness of various cryptocurrencies and algorithmic stablecoins. Although the proposed approach may help Terra, many investors are already doubting the credibility of other stablecoins. They still have a long way to go before garnering the trust of the public. Do you think this could be the end of stablecoins?  


Other algorithmic stablecoin initiatives may have learned something from the disaster. Other initiatives are taking precautions to avoid ending up in the same situation as Terra. The Tron DAO Reserve, for example, increased its reserves by purchasing millions in TRX, Bitcoin, and Tether to defend USDD, its stablecoin. Is it the time for exchanging your stablecoins for other currencies like ETH, BTC, etc? ETH can always be used for NFTs from communities like BAYC, High Sloth Society, etc. so it seems like a good option. BTC on the other hand is the currency that keeps driving the whole market with it, so it can be a good option too.

"74","The DAO is a concept based on blockchain technology, which eliminates the need for a central governing authority. Recently, DAOs have been getting quite a lot of attention from developers. Lets try to explain what having a DAO means in the crypto world.

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) does exactly what its name says - it is a group of people who work together to collectively govern and manage a certain project running on a [blockchain](https://getblock.io/blog/the-future-of-blockchain-and-why-you-should-learn-how-it-works/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo). DAOs are different from traditional boards of directors in the sense that they rely on sets of rules encrypted in code, otherwise known as smart contracts.

Unlike the old way, there is no hierarchy in a DAO. Users can purchase governance tokens, and depending on how many tokens they own, they get to play this or that role in voting on proposals and therefore participating in the companys future.

The first-ever DAO is believed to be the 2015 concept created by Stock.it. Wanting to raise money for Web3 startups, the team at Stock.it initiated an [Ethereum](https://getblock.io/nodes/eth/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo)\-based crowdfunding smart contract and additionally added voting and ownership rights. Lets just say it didnt go as planned. The first-ever DAO was not properly audited, resulting in a major draining bug not being fixed. The DAO was attacked multiple times. In the first few hours of the attack, the hacker managed to steal 3.6 million ETH ($70 million at that time), and once he had done enough damage, he withdrew.

"75","**What is a seed phrase?**

Its a recovery phrase  a set of 12-24 random words crypto wallets generate for you to access your assets. Wallets are used to store private keys, while seed phrases are the master passwords to them. If your wallet is removed or lost, the seed phrase will help you to restore it.

**How does a seed phrase work?**

You receive a seed phrase when you create your own wallet. Its randomly chosen from a list of 2048 words as established by the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39.

**How to store the seed phrase securely?**

You can write it down and keep copies in safe places, keep it spread around in various safe private locations or engrave it into a durable material such as stainless steel and waterproof paper.

**What happens if you lose a seed phrase?**

Unfortunately, your crypto is lost. It wont disappear, itll stay on the blockchain and you wont have any way to access it.

**The difference between a seed phrase and a private key**

Private keys are meant to spend your coins and tokens. A seed phrase allows you to access all private keys in the wallet.

**Storing your seed phrase with a third party**

This way you wont risk forgetting where you captured the phrase. However, youll be at a higher risk of hacks and you wont be in full control of your funds."

"85","If youre in [crypto](https://simplehold.io/blog/article/guide-on-how-defi-crypto-loans-work?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=education_post), you know that a crypto loan is a way of making your money work and grow. Especially when the market is in stagnation, and you dont gain any substantial profit. 

You might have heard about crypto loans here and there, but lets clarify everything and dot the I.

https://preview.redd.it/8gk0pdl369491.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09b47b95cb6ea4f61c02b5bfb084ce77baccb398

**How Do Crypto Loans Work?**  
When the market is stuck and you can't earn, you probably, lock the assets until the prices increase. But if there is any other option to make your money work? Crypto loans can be a solution. 

A crypto loan is a form of decentralized finance that investors can use to lend their crypto assets to borrowers who are seeking investors. In return, you'll earn interest payments or so-called 'crypto dividends.' 

The question is, why would a borrower want to borrow funds? Let's look at the example, you have Bitcoin ($BTC), and the Bitcoin market is on the rise. So, you don't want to sell it, but instead, use your Bitcoin as collateral, borrow a stablecoin such as Tether ($USDT) pegged to the U.S. dollar, and get liquidity. When you return your loan, you get your Bitcoins back, and if their value's increased in that interval, you won.  


**When Do You Need a Crypto Loan?**   
Thats a broad-spectrum of cases when you might need to use a crypto lending platform. Here are the most common:

1. **Reinvesting**  borrow your holdings against stablecoins and spend the funds to stack more of the same currencies you have.  

2. **Short-selling**  borrow your stablecoins against chosen assets and sell received cryptocurrencies at the current exchange rate.  

3. **Boost your passive income**  take out a crypto loan and add the released funds to earn more passive income;  

4. **Diversify your portfolio**  borrow your holdings against stablecoins and spend it to diversify your portfolio by adding various currencies;
5. **Daily purchases**  borrow your holdings against stablecoins, exchange them for fiat and spend for your day-to-day needs such as rent, travelling, clothes, or services without converting your crypto to fiat.

**Cryptocurrency Loan Collateral**  
Crypto lending platforms remove intermediaries in a blockchain-based ecosystem and provide crypto loan facilities. Thus, you cant get a crypto loan without cryptocurrency as collateral. 

Borrowers have to over-collateralize their debts to protect the lenders assets. Its used as there are no credit checks for borrowing crypto. So, if a borrower couldnt repay the debt, the collateral will be locked. This makes it possible for people with poor to no credit history to borrow crypto.

Another way of using collateral is to calculate an individual's lending risk and terms of the loan, such as payment period, interest rate, and amount of lendable funds. The higher the collateral, the lower lenders risk. 

For this, you should calculate Loan-to-Value (or LTV). LTV is the ratio of an individuals loan value to the value of their collateral. With LTV, crypto loan providers can evaluate individual lending risk levels. 

**Is a Crypto Loan Risky?**  
Since there are benefits to using your digital currency to secure a loan, there are also some drawbacks, and here they are:

**Margin calls**: it happens when your collaterals value decreases and the lender requires you to increase your holdings to manage the loan. 

**There isnt access to your assets**: when your loan has an outstanding balance, you cant access your holdings to trade or transact. 

**Repayment terms differ**: These loans usually function like traditional installment loans and depending on the crypto lending program, you may have less than a year to pay back what you borrowed. In other cases, you can create your own repayment schedule. With shorter repayment terms, its crucial that you know beforehand whether you can afford the payments.

**Limited assets:** it depends on the crypto lending platform you use, so you may need to swap your currency for an eligible asset that is supported by the platform.

**Account funds arent insured**: If you lend your own digital assets, the funds in a crypto interest account arent insured like your fiat money in the bank account. 

**Withdrawals can be slow**: You can request a withdrawal from your crypto interest account whenever you need it. Depending on the platform, it could take some time, though.

"90","It is been 13 years since the invention of Bitcoin, when we recap the path we have walked to date, one question always pop out of my mind: what we should make of Bitcoin? what makes Bitcoin distinct from the rest cryptocurrencies, given they are all, as the advocates promoted, sharing the similar properties such as transparency, anonymity, no authority manipulation, and set to be the ultimate solution to the chaos and disorder brought by a autocratic monetary system?

The unspoken answer to this question, lies in the distinctive visions for the right of users between Bitcoin Maximalist and Alt-coiners (including those who favor inventions across Web3, DAO, and Defi).

The Bitcoin Maximalist believe that Bitcoin is the sole solution to the corrupted Fiat system and the ultimate alternative payment method in the digital era, and this has been supported by BTCs dominance over the entire crypto market since its invention. While they admit the existence of alt-coins, they believe those are just the mimics of Bitcoin, most of which hardly survive over the next few years, even though clothed in fancy features like programmability, inter-compatibility etc.

The Alt-coiners often have respect for Bitcoin, however, they believe the notion that Bitcoin has been proofed unable to solve all the negative affects brought by Fiat system, nor to meet the new features focusing on various use cases, where the alt-coins are perfectly competing with Bitcoin. In their eyes, programable cryptocurrencies will eventually surpass old-fashioned Bitcoin.

So Bitcoin Maximalist, Alt-coiners, which side you pick up? Or you just prefer none?"

Africa is the second largest continent in the world with 1.5 billion people,which should in itself make it a huge market for any industry, however the continents geography, climate and tumultuous  colonial history  have hindered the prospects of its development especially in areas such as tech that require huge investments.  


The first prerequisite to developing various areas of tech is having a developed telecommunications infrastructure however this requires enormous funds that African companies and states  lack.  


Traditional  Telekom companies are a huge network consisting of thousands of people and have incredibly complex infrastructures that are costly to operate which would make them unsustainable in certain parts of Africa.  
Blockchain tech can change that !  


if you are wondering how it  can improve the odds of companies like Giant, Tok Lok, World Mobile Token, Telcoin in succeeding in such a  tumultuous  market, you have to have a deep understanding of what blockchain is and how it works.  


To cut the unnecessarily long story short applying it in this sector could mean that companies would require far fewer employees and far less infrastructure required to get their business started, that would also mean the costs for people looking for such a service wouldn't be as prohibitively expensive because of the fixed costs that would be lower for companies.  


Also some of these companies are developing NFT based nodes that could be rented out to individuals which would in turn get a part of the profits, making it more easy to raise funds.  


What do you think about this, is this idea worth contemplating or is this market too difficult to swallow for new companies ?"

"99","I am a forester by trade, and really want to be able to open up investment into the forestry industry on a smaller scale. In the UK one of the largest land managers Gresham House operates with around a 40k buy in, after this you are essentially paid out high yield dividends yearly. 

Obviously not many people have 40k, and so I am trying to figure out a way of breaking a woodland into smaller stands in order to allow people to buy ""a piece"" (A coin).   
This is complicated because if I owned a 100ha woodland worth say 100k. I could break it up into 1ha pieces and sell them relative to the value of the woodland.

I know of an American housing company basically doing the same thing, houses are put up for rent. and you can buy x ""shares"" (coins) that are always sellable and pay a monthly dividend which is basically a share of the rent. 

Part of my problem would be that due to the nature of forestry a rotation is around 35/40 years. and so to pay dividends on coin ownership there would need to be a period of time that someone's initial investment would be locked. I know this sounds squiddish, its just that without an initial lockup period it wouldn't be possible to begin to pay out dividends. 

Essentially, the initial buy in would be a stake in an existing woodland. then the capital raised from selling ""shares"" (coins) would buy another woodland. this woodland would be at another point in its rotation. and this would carry on until there are enough woodlands to pay out yearly to all coin owners. the reason being is that if 10 woodlands had a 3.5 year break in production then you would be processing a huge amount of timber every 3.5 years which equates to a huge amount of money. Even more importantly if you had say 35 woodlands that had a year between them you would be harvesting yearly meaning huge dividends to coin holders. 

Basically, my idea is turning traditional investing into a approachable vehicle to generate money. without ""old money"" buy ins. Timber markets aside, I don't think there is any volatility to be seen aside from an initial ""buy in"" period that could be difficult. Please if anyone has any advice or tips on how to approach this, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Many thanks,

Adagio."

BattleMechs on Android. Earn **Gemz** ([BattleMechs price today, GEMZ to USD live, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/battlemechs/)) while playing the game. It is based on the Zilliqa blockchain [r/Zilliqa](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zilliqa/) ([Zilliqa price today, ZIL to USD live, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zilliqa/))

Whitepaper: [https://whitepaper.battlemechs.co/](https://whitepaper.battlemechs.co/)

BattleMechs is a revolutionary play-to-earn blockchain game bridging the gap between mobile gaming and crypto. Via a custom build software development kit for the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/), BattleMechs creates a smooth user-experience akin to traditional mobile games.

BattleMechs has integrated with the [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/854415cf3d214371a7b60cf01ead0918) and [Zilliqa blockchain](https://zilliqa.com/). Upon starting the mobile app players are automatically generated a Zilliqa and Ethereum wallet. There are no requirements to use additional blockchain wallets and or extentions such as Metamask or Trust Wallet.

Having all blockchain related wallets and transactions directly managed from within the BattleMechs app allows for a traditional mobile gaming experience, in addition to making the process of interacting with the blockchain a lot more approachable for non-technical users. Powered by [BLOX-SDK.com](https://blox-sdk.com/) .

=÷ Play-for-free, no deposit required  
=÷ Earn rare NFT loot and $GEMZ by mining

Powered by **Zilliqa** and BLOX-SDK

It's on Google play store currently, not available on iOS as of yet.

**If you use my code**: **Memz** you get free 10 GEMZ in-game, here it is: [BattleMechs](https://battlemechs.co/referral?code=memz)

Edit: It is currently still in development, but the game allows you to mine ever 6 hours and everytime you complete it, you earn 2 Gemz. Which equals to $1.30 every 6 hours of mining. Which I think is amazing. So potentially you're looking at $5 daily earning without even doing anything.

Enjoy!"

"111","They have various interest earning USDT products, maturing after 84 and 364 days, they are now simply refusing to return funds to clients once the products mature, instead they made a series of posts on their website informing clients the products will be temporarily and automatically extended (indefinitely at a lower rate of interest), clients have no way to recover their funds. 

Please do your own research, to me it looks like an exit scam, I have a small amount of money with them, they did not even take the time to email (or ask) the clients if they agree with this, they just posted a notice on their website.

"113","So have you heard about this legal case going on in Brazil  right now involving Binance ?

Now basically a guy had loads Of SHIB coins and somehow he was hacked, his coins were on a platform called MetaMask and using analysis he found out that his coins were transferred to Binance.

Of course he contacted Binance and asked them to lock the wallet, at first they said they were going to do it but later just ignored him leading to a court case in front of a Brazilian court, can you believe this. ?

Binance argued in front of the court they had no connection to MetaMask and therefore didn't lock the wallet despite  the proof submitted, what do you guys think about this ?

I'm on Binance right now but have no idea whether to continue being here because of this, I understand that they are just protecting their business but come on.

Would you consider switching to other exchanges like Coinbase or Dura-fi and do you know of similar cases involving them and could you recommend some other reputable and secure exchanges ?

I understand that I might be taking this to seriously but I tend to take notice of these things !"
"114","In a decentralized market, the decision making in companies whether its an investment or policies changing decision, will be done through voting by holders of a specific governance token. 


Traditional governance has a pyramid of power and those overseeing have control over what happens, which will make the rest of the community feel like they dont have a say, and means that investments dont truly reflect what the people want or their interests. 


But blockchain is turning the tables through the rise of DAOs that are enabled by governance tokens, allowing token holders to build a real community and be heard within that community. 


For example, BIT holders vote on which project should BitDAO support next, what changes should be implemented in the future, while also having access to one of cryptos most diverse and liquid treasuries. 


So if you compare traditional governance with decentralized governance, youll have on one hand a project/company/organization with a community thats less engaged and that reflects the views of only a few interested and powerful parties, and on the other hand youll have a project thats giving the power to the people."

"116","Okay so crypto has been in a bit of a decline lately and although that's nothing to worry about in the long run it has gotten me thinking to diversify my portfolio of investments.  


I started searching for new unexplored markets and new sectors where blockchain might go because it is almost inevitable that blockchain will reach almost all tech sectors because of the techs versatility and ability to bring change for the better wherever it comes.  


Now my belief (and of course I could be  mistaken this is just my personal analysis and I encourage you to make your own ) is that the best sector to invest in is the telecommunications sector and that the best market to try is the African market.  


My reasons for this belief is that only 25 percent of Africa has internet penetration and the telekom sector is in a dire need of an overhaul because rising costs and ever increasing demands demand the usage of blockchain.  


I've heard of companies like World Mobile Token, Giant and Telcoin going in the similar direction and I think they might be onto something profitable however I still have my doubts.  


What are your opinions on my analysis, and where would you invest ?"
"117"," In a relatively short period of time, NFTs have wreaked havoc on the crypto market.

As a large fan of art, collecting, and NFTs, this period in art when art and the NFT world collide inspires me much. NFT is reaching a wider range of enterprises, fashion houses, and designers, according to what we're hearing.  

To be honest, I began collecting at a young age, starting with marbles, sports cards, and other small items. NFT collecting attracted me as I grew older and witnessed the growth of technology, but I still wanted to keep the tactile part of collecting.

 I've just visited a few different markets/projects, both for gaming and art, and I must say that I really enjoy how SK8coin is going and can't wait to see all of their new collections. 

But I've found that I'm always spinning the same ones, so I forced myself to go out and find some new ones to see what other options I had with new NFTs. This Ludo Showcase, which operates similarly to Instagram for NFTs, is an extremely useful searching tool when it comes to the new NFT collection.

Now understand that this is just the way that cryptos in general 'behave' but unless you had some serious foresight and are seriously in crypto you were not happy these couple of weeks.  


My question to you is, as I suppose most of you are on Binance (as am I ),are there any other marketplaces for crypto where you trade or acquire your hard earned assets that are just as Big and reliable. Of course I've heard of dozens of them like Dura-Fi and Coinbase but I am a  kind of a person that doesn't test out anything new unless I am certain that it is checked out, safe and recommended by a lot of people, this is especially true when it comes to my money.  


So I want to hear your recommendations and opinions about new markets. If there are any or do you recommend I just stick to  Binance."

Yes, our SIM cards have shrunk in size, and we now have a plethora of ways to send audio, video, and text over the internet, but the underlying telephone logic based on SIM cards (which were first established in 1991) has remained same.   


The way we handle data has radically altered.   
The speed of internet transfer today cannot be compared to three or four years ago.   


5G, which is presently being tested, will enable ever faster data transfer rates, minimal network latency, and a massive network of interconnect devices.

With both customers and providers struggling with increasing fees, roaming risks of fraud I believe decentralization that can be achieved by utilizing blockchain technology is the way to go and I have heard that some companies like Giant and World Mobile Token have already taken this approach and I believe that investment in this sector could bring money if timed right.

"123","With ETH sinking lower and lower should we start looking elsewhere ?  


To be honest from day one I have been an ETH enthusiast and trading it and mining it brought me a lot and I mean a lot of money however as of late I have not been so fortunate and I suppose neither have any of us.   


I usually avoid any other crypto currencies shot coins, meme coins, stable coins as they have proven time and time again that they are a disaster and I would rather make steady income with ETH than hope for some bull coin to go to 1000 times its price ( realistically go to zero).   


However coins aren't the only thing crypto related, there are companies that utilize blockchain that concentrate on emerging sectors such as Telekoms, Space Tech, Energy, hell even Healthcare (for example, World Mobile Token, WePower, Space Chain) and those look to me more serious because they don't concentrate solely on algorhitms and supply and demand but have a business model behind them.  


Of course that doesn't mean they will be more successful always DYOR.  


So what do you think stay with ETH hope for the best or try something new out, could me more risky but O don't like this new situation and I am strugling to find a mew alternative and sitting and waiting doesn't sit with me."

"126","Now applications of blockchain are many and in my quest to find the right sector to invest in I have found dozens of companies that apply blockchain tech to improve their business and sustainability.  


I believe that companies that actually have a backing   in an actual business rather than just minting worthless coins could have a future as they are not just reliant on algorithms  but also their business performance and it is less likely they are pump and dump schemes.   


Of course I am not telling you to invest in any of these without researching them first ( neither have I, I am just considering )  I don't want anyone losing their money because they listened to me   


I found a lot of interesting applications for blockchain like space tech, sustainable energy, telecommunication, retail, even healthcare and companies like Giant, World Mobile Token, Ledger, Space Chain investing in these ideas.  


However I would like to hear your advice as I have no one in my surroundings that invests in crypto, which of these sectors would you put your money in, or do you have any other that you would consider ?   


And again please don't bombard me with stablecoins or memecoin projects  as I am not interested, half of them are fraud and an accident waiting to happen."
"127","Now Estonia has been voting online since 2006, you might be thinking, then why do we need blockchain if they already have the mechanism. Well for one Estonia is a small country, second blockchain is a much more secure way, just the size of countries like the USA, UK, Germany means that in order to implement such a voting mechanism would require an incredibly complex system.  


However several questions arise as to how you would implement blockchain and not all of them are tech related.  


The first one is the question of digital ID that would have to be incredibly secure and probably also based on blockchain, there are companies like World Mobile Token, TokLok and even Microsoft engaged in this area so we can safely assume that a solution to this problem will be found.  


The second 'batch' of problems is social issues. These can be more challenging than the actuall tech, remember the mail in votes from the last election ? People were claiming that elections were hacked, stolen etc and they would most certainly do it again even if these claims don't have a basis in reality this must also be addressed.   


And of course if in any way the system is actually compromised it will have nationwide implications.  


The thing that would improve the most is voter turnout because I imagine a lot more people would vote if it took them 3 seconds to do it.  


There are numerous pros and cons to this subject so I am interested in your opinion do you think this kind of system should be implemented and do you see any implications that I have missed ?"

"129"," Did you know that the first-ever consensus algorithm called Paxos was created in 1989? Its initial goal was to enable a distributed network of computers to work continuously even under unpredictable unstable conditions. With the introduction of blockchain technology, consensus algorithms have been recognized on a larger scale. Simply put, a consensus algorithm is an agreement protocol implemented by a blockchain to verify all sorts of data.

An algorithm verifies newly added blocks of data, guarantees the legitimacy of the block, and is agreed upon by all members (nodes) of the decentralized network.[In this article, we will focus on a few of the most popular algorithms](https://getblock.io/blog/what-is-a-blockchain-consensus-algorithm-and-how-does-it-work/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo), discuss their working principles, and give some examples of where and how they are used.

"130","Yes I see hundreds of posts on reddit of people crying how the government should step  in  to regulate crypto in order to stop something like LUNA disaster from happening again.  


They are completely right, because whenever the government steps in and regulates something like let us say, the stock market there is no longer a chance for fraud there, or people losing money right, yeah my point exactly.  


Crypto was made to be decentralized, also transparent and can in a way regulate itself the other way is for people to start using their brains doing their research before they invest in a project or coin, the red flags were there for Luna if only you wanted to see, and some projects despite being decent just fail, that is how crypto works, this is how everything works in the world and no amount of regulation will change that.   


There are a lot of projects that I invest in and a lot of projects that I am interested in like World Mobile Token, Empowa, SpaceChain, Ledger, Toklok those might be successful or they might not be I don't know, but those are or will be my choices  and I ALONE am responsible for what happens and if it fails it will be my fault alone.  


I simply cannot understand that people have this mindset where they refuse to use their heads and take responsibility  and are like 'ooh let the government do it for me' and relinquish their freedoms just so they might have a false sense of security.  


As if somebody forced them to invest in crypto if it is too risky for you, then just get a job at a 7/11 and leave the rest of us be, you wouldn't be complaining if the investment made you a lot of money would you, because whatever has the capacity to get you a lot of money has the capacity to lose you a lot of money and the government is not going to change that."

"135","The latest breakthrough technological advances have made it possible for developers to create new kinds of products. One that is especially promising is the introduction of decentralized applications ([dApp](https://getblock.io/blog/how-to-build-a-dapp-blockchain-developer-is-starter-pack-by-getblock/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo)), which are heavily reliant on blockchains and crypto.

At its core, each dApp combines a smart contract (a backend) and a frontend user interface. dApps are built by utilizing fully transparent codes governed by autonomy, and a specific consensus algorithm to back up their value (e.g. [Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Work](https://getblock.io/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-whats-the-difference/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo)).

Most applications we use in our day-to-day life are centralized. This means that everything contained and posted on the app, including its database, is owned and controlled by a single - centralized - entity. Some of the centralized apps examples are Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. dApps are fundamentally different in their structure.

N.B. Check out Getblocks [guide](https://getblock.io/blog/how-to-build-a-dapp-blockchain-developer-is-starter-pack-by-getblock/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) on how to build a dApp

As mentioned above, dApps are centered around blockchains with smart contract support. A smart contract is essentially a self-executing program stored on a blockchain, which contains an agreement between the seller and the buyer in the form of a specific code. Blockchains, which offer smart contract support, provide efficient and censorship-resistant solutions for dApp developers.

The list of such blockchains includes [*Ethereum (ETH)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/eth/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo)*,* [*Binance Smart Chain (BSC)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/bsc/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo)*,* [*Polygon (previously Matic Network, MATIC)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/matic/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo)*,* [*Tron (TRX)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/trx/)*,* [*Near (NEAR)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/near/)*,* [*Solana (SOL)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/sol/)*,* etc.

New companies can focus on growing and scaling their business, while also raising funds worldwide, onboarding new employees from everywhere across the globe. 


As an investor, I would much rather put my money into a DAO based project over any other types of projects, because I have voting powers to choose where my funds should be invested, and community members collectively decide whats the future of this project. 


Theres a significant growth in the number of DAOs this year, and BitDAO is one of the contributors to this rise, because its community owns the worlds largest DAO directed treasury, and is using this treasury to support developers in building their DAOs.

That is not where its' application can end.

"140","Bitcoin (BTC) last traded above $50,000 on December 27, 2021. Four months have passed since then, but traders appear to be hopeful that inflation has reached the right level to spur bitcoin adoption.  


In principle, 8.5 percent inflation in the United States means that prices increase by 50% every five years. This effectively reduces the purchase power of the dollar by 33%, turning $100 into $66. Is this the fall of USD?  


On May 4, the Federal Reserve (FOMC) of the United States is likely to make a decision on interest rates, but more crucially, the FED is expected to unveil a scheme to unload some of its $9 trillion balance sheet. As a result, rather than supporting the debt and mortgage markets, the Federal Reserve will most certainly sell $95 billion worth of these assets each month. Do you think this could affect the crypto market as well?   


Risk markets have factored in the possibility of catastrophic outcomes. In 2022, the Russell 2000 mid-capitalization stock market index, for example, is down 16.5 percent year to date. Similarly, the Chinese stock market has had a 20% year-to-date correction, as assessed by the MSCI China index. Is this the time for investing? I've recently heard of some communities including High Sloth Society, ROSE, etc. What do you think about that? This may actually be something called a discounted market.  


It's impossible to predict what would set off a Bitcoin bull run, but Glassnode reported on April 18 that ""a considerable quantity of coin supply"" had accumulated between $38,000 and $45,000.

Is it really just chaotic,when fomo kicks in - as the result of chaotic market processes and trading algorithms? 
It should be possible to analyze the preceding transactions and the trades on the BTC blockchain at the start of the bullrun. Have there been certain whales buying? Or was it a lot of small trades?

I would say all these meme Coins are definitly in a danger, on the other hand i think ADA, XPR(no not XRP, i mean protonchain), as also XTZ are no brainers... By Zilliqa im not sure yet but there my stumach has also good feelings...

There was no financial advice"

As of right now, there are plenty of countries in Europe that have great crypto tax policies, and nothing is stopping you from enjoying your gains over there."

I am not even sure why people bother with it any more, perhaps it was a good idea, but years have passed and not a single good iteration of that idea has come to fruition. Zero. Nada.  


It went from  allegedly  95 percent good  projects, to 50 percent good projects to 99 percent scam and now it is all scam  apart from this awesome amazing project that happens to be mine. (As someone smart recently said on reddit ).   


I am kind of noticing a tendency in crypto that people seem to really really like projects doomed to fail, and the more everyone screams this is the future and this will get you a 20 percent return of investment every year the more everyone seems to like it.  


I have heard of several good projects that concentrate on application of blockchain in areas like Telekom, Banking, Energy, Space Tech (World Mobile Token, WePower, SpaceChain)  
even bloody medical insurance and I can't remember the last time I read something about that on reddit (of course I could be wrong about any of these and it could all go to hell )   


Instead all I read is thousands of articles mentioning worthless web3 scams, stablecoin scams and all kind of other stupidity without any idea behind but 'this is a sure thing, profits guaranted) what are you Warren Buffet ?"
"148","TL;DR Like clockwork, BTC has always had H 80% correction from its previous ATH. BTCs at a 43% correction from its previous ATH.

This is for the noobs, Hodl cult boys, and the moon boys. Dont encourage people to buy the dip; especially, when BTC has always corrected from its all-time high to All Time Low by 80%. We are NOT at 80% from bitcoins  previous all-time high. Currently, bitcoin has had a 43% correction from its recent all-time high. Thus, buying now would be wrektastic unless youre dollar cost averaging a specified amount every single week or month.

"155","Web 3.0 is the revolutionary mechanism through which you will have the power over your data, your identity and crucially be rewarded as content creators and consumers.

The [saynetwork.io](https://saynetwork.io) ecosystem epitomises these attributes, it is facilitated by its uSAY app which is almost 70% developed and, it consists of the uLIVE and uNFT marketplace functionalities.

The Say Network community led team is building Solanas network first successful permissionless reward orientated social media platform where you will be paid with the $Say token for engaging in the ecosystem and from advertisement revenue redistribution.

The team plans to migrate the $SAY token from Solana network to its own Layer-1 Blockchain in the future.

Users and creators of the Say Network ecosystem will get 70% of ad revenue.

The social activity coefficient, or SAC, is a major ingredient in the Say Network secret sauce. The SAC algorithm will be implemented as a set of smart contracts deployed to the Say Network layer one. These contracts are responsible for analyzing and tracking content interaction relative to users within the Say Network ecosystem. The SAC, over time, will have the ability to recognize quality content and provide the mechanics for users to identify that content. A piece of content will have a higher number of plays and actions taken on a media object if the content distribution is favoured based on users content variety through the systems algorithm which is mathematically evaluated. The SAC will quantify based on the content distribution and content variety of the evaluated media object.

Along with self-sovereignty, Say Network aims to enable users to be rewarded for recognizing content that is popular before it becomes so. Through the use of the SAY token, users are able to incentivize the ecosystem to develop quality content in the hopes the platform fosters and promotes what makes us human and does not detract from it.

Users of the Say Network ecosystem apps will be able to claim rewards based on the SAC value accrued per user straight from hour social media profile dashboard which will be measured on every 24 hour epoch interval."
"156","Okay I am not going to be overly optimistic this e-stablecoin  because for one this is still a concept that needs to be implemented and all kinds of stable coins have failed so far in rather spectacular fashion.  


However the concept in itself is very unique and I must say this is the first great idea for blockchain implementation after quite some time.  


Now I've heard of many applications in many sectors like Space Tech, Healthcare, Telecommunications (World Mobile Token, Wepower, Spacechain) however a currency tied to electricity  really caught my eye.  


Now how this would work would pretty much be mining these coins where electricity is cheap and burning them where it is more expensive, simple enough it seems however deceptively so because the scientists still need some concepts to be worked out.  


The price of electricity (for now) is pretty stable however that doesn't mean that this is a sure thing, many things can go wrong depending on the algorithm as proven by other stable coins however some time has to pass before we see whether this is a good idea or not, I would not write it off just yet.  


What are your opinions on this would you trade your crypto in exchange for electricity do you think this is a good idea, maybe brilliant, maybe not ?"
"157","Not my original post, but think this is useful to put in context. If BTC eventually decreases -82% peak-to-trough (as it did in the two past cycles), we could see a further \~56% drawdown in just BTC alone. It is down 59% now, but \[18% of ATH / 41% of ATH\] = 44%, so 56% decline).

The same math for Ethereum, referencing only the 2017-2018 cycle, would imply another possible 81% fall  (19% = 6% of ATH/31% of ATH)

Even if BTC/ETH fall 56%-81% further, alt coins will obviously even more.

"160","I get it, the main selling point of a P2E game is that it offers passive income for users while they play a game. Its fun, its attractive and I get that.

However, focusing on that and ENTIRELY forgetting about graphics, storyline, and game mechanics is very counterproductive.

A couple 100 dollars from a game are cool but I dont think that alone theyre enough to get people to move over from gaming consoles to P2E games.

I just dont see enough development honestly. By far the only chain that has some good games is Polygon. Aavegotchi is pretty entertaining and their tokens price has been holding up amazingly compared to all other coins and tokens on the market. Arc8 is also designed in a way that makes it pretty addictive with some pretty good gaming mechanics. It also helps that Polygon has one of the most efficient VMs making these NFT pretty profitable.

So while there are a couple of exceptions, the vast majority of P2E games become literal clones and developers dont seem too keen on providing more entertainment to these games.

If these devs keep up this pace then the P2E market will slowly start losing interest among the masses and that would be a huge blow for the metaverse and crypto as a whole."

Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin by market capitalization USDT, has seen a reduction in the assets circulating supply after investors withdrew over $7 billion from it.

The development came shortly after USDT briefly lost its peg to the US dollar on some exchanges, dropping to $0.96 in the wake of the Terra UST saga. Although USDT has regained its dollar parity on trading platforms, investors seemed to have lost some confidence following a withdrawal of $7 billion from the stablecoin.

Tethers stablecoin reserve has come under criticism, with arguments as to whether USDT is indeed backed 1:1 to the US dollar. However, it is very important to note that Tethers CTO confirmed on multiple occasions that the company backing USDT  Tether  continued redeeming the stablecoin at its value ($1), meaning that the peg remained unfazed.

Similar to how individuals hedge their portfolios from volatility risks by holding multiple coins, some projects hold different coins or stablecoins to protect themselves from bear markets, and minimize loss risks. 


No one can be 100% certain of the performance of the market, especially in a market as volatile as the crypto market since its an emerging market and panic sellers exist, resulting in a drastic decrease in a coins value. 


One example is BIT that didnt get affected by the crash like other altcoins did, since BItDAO holds BIT, ETH, USDT, USDC, FTT, WETH, and xSUSHI in its treasury, making it one of the most diverse, versatile and liquid crypto assets in the market.

"170","For those unfamiliar with Decentralized Finance, [DeFi](https://getblock.io/blog/how-to-build-a-dapp-blockchain-developer-is-starter-pack-by-getblock/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) describes a concept- or a type of [Decentralized Application](https://getblock.io/blog/what-is-a-dapp-everything-you-need-to-know-about-dapps/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) \- which allows users to manage an entire spectrum of financial operations by utilizing blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, and eliminates the need for third-party involvement. Having said that, DeFi is drastically different from the traditional way of financial communication we know.

Heres how DeFi projects are making a difference in the traditional banking industry.

Centralized Finance

Money has been the means of human exchange for centuries, with the first ever known currency - the Mesopotamian shekel - being around 5,000 years old. This is also the time when the concept behind centralized finance was conceived.

In centralized finance, the control over money is appointed to financial institutions, e.g. banks, which play the role of middlemen and have an overlapping goal of earning a profit (hence, they like to charge fees).

With the introduction of the first cryptocurrency - [Bitcoin](https://getblock.io/dedicated-nodes/btc/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) \- things have changed. According to some experts, Bitcoin could become the new, most effective option for storing value, as it does not require a trusted third party to perform operations. Besides, it has purchasing power, liquidity and authority.

At the same time, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges entered the market. Binance, Coinbase, Kraken still remain one of the most important transacting vehicles for millions of crypto holders around the world.

Decentralized Finance

Decentralized Finance came in a bit later. With DeFi, it is possible to conduct transactions with no middlemen involved. As DeFi projects run on blockchain technology, they use [consensus mechanisms](https://getblock.io/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-whats-the-difference/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) to verify the data on the network. DeFi provides all kinds of transparent, fast and inexpensive financial services. Smart contracts, supported by blockchain technology, contain the rules of operation written in the form of a traceable code. Any decentralized application offering financial services could be considered a DeFi project.

N.B. Check out Getblocks [guide](https://getblock.io/blog/how-to-start-a-defi-project/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) on how to start a DeFi project

"171","As once said by someone very smart in a show that used to be very good.  Right now chaos is an excellent term to describe what's going on in the world, looming recession, prices of food that are sky high and gas prices that I don't even need to comment things are not looking good.  


Crypto has also been affected, entering a period of stagnation of its own. BTC and ETH are on the low side, people have been losing money left and right and although we do sympathize we also need to see the opportunity that arises with prices being so low.   


Of course this is no financial advice only my personal observation and always do your own research but I believe that investing right now when the prices are at their lowest can be a very smart move, of course only if you believe that they will jump again.  


That's how the rich always emerge richer after crisis situations because they buy things when they cost less instead of selling them (I understand of course that some people can't afford to  do this and must sell things in order to survive, not trying to be insensitive).  


My two ideas on how to profit from this situation are to either invest in good Crypto like ETH that will probably rebound ( This kind of market will probably clear out all the worthless shitcoins) or invest in strong NFT communities like Cryptopunk, High Sloth Society, BAYC etc when the price for entering them is not so steep.   


So what do you think about my opinion does it pay off to make a risk in promise of a greater reward and trying to take advantage of this situation."

"181","June 8th, 2022:

Guardian Token, the ERC20 token that powers guardianplatform.io, has announced a collaboration with industry leader Benzinga on the data analysis of an ongoing set of crypto and digital asset surveys.

Benzinga is a global powerhouse of approximately 25 million monthly readers and is a hub for actionable information on capital markets.  This collaboration with Guardian Token &amp; guardianplatform.io will help to provide valid and relevant data points directly from real cryptocurrency and digital asset investors to the Guardian program management team.  This data will drive the ongoing and future development of guardianplatform.io to provide real world utility solutions to all investors for some of the biggest issues within the crypto and digital asset space, thus improving the overall user experience.

Guardianplatform.io recently launched as an MVP (minimum viable product) crypto and digital asset research and education platform.  Even in it's initial release state, the Guardian Platform is capable of competing with some of the most used research and education platforms in the space.  Here you can find up to the second token data, market news, top gainers &amp; losers, in depth token data with links to official project channels, CEX &amp; DEX information, and more.  However the similarities stop there.

Additional features within guardianplatform.io include the G-Hub, a community based directory where organizations and people within the crypto and digital asset space can collaborate, share, learn, find services, and make connections.  There are also partnerships with Scratch Engine (NFT Evalutation Tool) and Sharity (Crypto Charity Platform), and an affiliation with FEGex already in place.  Looking at ongoing and future development within the Guardian Platform, components such as Technical Analysis, BrainStem, SpyDr, Whale WatchR, BagTrax, Herald, Genalock, Risk Assessment, and Token Strength will be key aspects of this user-focused platform. These components will enter phased development cycles based on prioritization, and two (BrainStem and Technical Analysis) have already commenced.

The results will be a fully integrated SSO (single sign on) capable of managing all your crypto currency and digital asset research and education needs, thus making guardianplatform.io a true powerhouse tool for investors throughout all sectors of the crypto and digiatal asset space.

The current open survey on guardianplatform.io is focused on Crytpo Currency and Digital Assets.  Future surveys being developed are:

Q2 2022 - Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT's)

Q3 2022 - Gaming

Q3 2022 - Digital Identity &amp; Security

If interested simply go to guardianplatform.io to take the surveys.  While there take a moment to see what this project is building.  A tool built by investors for investors is a powerful thing, and this collaboration with Benzinga will put the Guardian Token and guardianplatform.io over the top!"

So basically, if youre reading this right now, youre most probably using Linux.

I think Cartesi is the only crypto projects with that vision in their mind cause theyre the only ones with an engine that runs Linux OS which will I think will give Cartesi a lot of advantage honestly.

Running a crypto project on this OS will make it so easy for the mass populous to be able to use said project which will most probably ensure mainstream adoption pretty early on."
"184","You may call the price movements over the preceding six months anything you choose. Even if we've improved slightly in the last two months, we're still on the decrease. But, in the case of a drop, I believe we all know what to do. Yes, make the purchase. You should try to time your fall such that you are at the bottom and can restock your supplies. Even if we fall lower, everyone who does that is smart, since no one will notice if you bought at 40k or 47k in ten years.  


However, acquiring knowledge is another thing to do to completely gain from a terrible market. Because there aren't as many hopium-traders during a bad market as there are during a bull market, you can learn the most about the market. Learn how people react to a little pump during certain periods, for example, and how it goes. Instead, do some study to learn about new concepts. Cardano, ROSE, and now High Sloth Society were all found this way. Keep an eye on the situation.  


I'd even go so far as to argue that if you can't afford the dip due to financial constraints, it's not an issue. Simply by monitoring the bear market, you may profit from it. Experience is the key to success."
"185","Typically alts fall so much when BTC is falling, at least 5 to 10% more. For the last two days, BTC is falling so much but not alts, instead, they are in up trend a little. Will alts not fall anymore because they have been staked by validators? What I have been thinking is, for example, that FTM is not going below 19 cents which is because the remaining amount might be in the hands of validators or the FTM company? Please correct me If I am thinking wrong."

"187","What I mean is that theres a lot of development going on in the market that is very bullish. Its just that this development isnt being reflected on the prices at the moment obviously because the entire world is experiencing a recession.

But as long as the fundamentals are still there and were seeing constant development then Im not really that worried.

Development is a great indicator of how the market is heading and right now were seeing some pretty big headlines.  
Were starting to see a domino effect of governments acceptance cryptocurrencies as legal tender. Major influential companies like Apple will onboard billions of people into the crypto world.

Development also hasnt been stopping. For those scared about Ethereums future, the development with L2s is at an all time high with projects like Zksync getting a $200 million grant from BitDAO to develop ZkDAO (which will apparently be a scaling solution focused solely on DAOs)  
Other L2s like Loopring and Starkware also have a ton of new projects on the way.

If you just close the red charts for a second and see whats going outside of exchanges, youd feel a strong sense of relief. The crypto market is acting like there literally isnt a thing going on. In fact, I bet that if you tried to tell prices based on development and without looking at charts, you wouldnt be able to guess were in the red."
"188","Hi everyone :) I wanted to share a project that I have been building for the crypto community over the last 3 years. 

Our site [Cryptoranker.io](https://cryptoranker.io) just launched, its the first crypto-centric crowd ranker and review forum and we are seeking public beta users. CryptoRanker Inc. uses crowd wisdom to call out the shitcoins, inviting holders to share their knowledge and experiences to help self-regulate the crypto industry. The free web platform features a robust review forum and a ranker (FUD-meter) that measures thousands of cryptos based on five fundamental metrics.

Every cryptos aggregate FUD-meter score is made up of five metrics (tech, team, community, use case, and publicity). Definitions are inclusive of all varieties of coins and tokens.

Using the site is free, fun, and easy. Any hodler or trader is invited to join CryptoRanker in its mission to sort the gems from the shitcoins.

Cheers!"

Just last week, Japan became the first significant economy to pass a [**bill for investor protection**](https://beincrypto.com/japan-passes-landmark-law-around-stablecoins-to-protect-investors-after-terra-debacle/) when it comes to risks of stablecoins.

Im reading news about that the MonkeyPoxInu (MPOX) turned out to be a scam, since allegedly the developers ran away with investors money which is about $400M.


I honestly think that anyone that fell for this scam was either trying to make quick profits, or theyre genuinely gullible, I mean I cant even imagine what this coins marketing strategy was to attract all those investors. 


We should try and point out obvious scams as much as possible, to help new comers not fall for hypes, and guide them to invest in more community focused projects, like DAO based projects. 


One example is BitDAO thats community led, where BIT holders vote on which project to support next, aiming to build a tokenized economy that everyone can become a part of. 


And if theyre more NFT-oriented they can look into DAOs like PleasrDAO, that aims to collect digital art that represents and funds important ideas, movements and causes that have been memorialized on-chain as NFTs. 


Also, individually researching the team behind any new startup, has proven to be a great technique for me to draw the line between projects with actual utilities, and ones that only rely on hypes."

However, I this hasnt been stopping companies from buying cryptocurrencies and even implementing chains and protocols into their businesses.

This gives even more confidence in the future of crypto cause if I know one thing, it is that top major companies rarely ever take bad financial decisions. Of course, there will always be exceptions with bad decisions, but the way that these major companies reached the top is through teams of financial consultants leading the way in the background.

So fact that these companies are entering the crypto makes me want to stay to see how the future of the market turns out.

You got UbiSoft and Atari, two of the largest gaming developers in the world, are developing games in the P2E market.  
GameStop has already made huge waves in the crypto community. And Stripe, the 5th largest fintech company in the world and the 6th most used payment app in the US is working with Polygon. Also, Instagram is working with Polygon as well to enable users to display their NFT on their profiles.

If you have a sound money system based on math (e.g Bitcoin, Monero etc), something that has a stable low inflation rate which nobody can manipulate then you no longer need Gold to back a currency.

With Gold, you need to trust the third party not to screw you over.

Some basic BTC ideas going into the weekend. 

* The descending triangle should break lower
* The rising wedge should break lower
* The descending triangle lower support was regained but with low volume
* If the descending triangle support is lost again, watch for a retest and then a most to the range lows (could be lower than the $27k level I have marked)

Once of my favorite strategies recently has been trading the bull and bear traps. It's one of the highest success rate trading methods I use, it just doesn't happen very frequently being that it is always against the probability. But this idea is shown on the chart with the blue area. On a retest of range higher is where I will be loading with longs, until then just short term trading.

"200","For those of you that don't know who Madison Cawthorne is, he is a  politician and soon to be former Congressman of NC, for those that do know him no introduction is needed. What I am about to say has nothing to do with him being a member of any particular party or his political leanings. I am not a fan of either party.  


And yes you have read the title correctly he is now under House investigation because he was essentially shilling a coin (won't mention the name of the coin if you are really interested you can easily find it ).  


Of course this isn't your everyday reddit shilling this is high profile manipulation at its best (allegedly) with him being accused of having financial interest in a coin he previously promoted.  


For me this is beyond disgusting, crypto is supposed to be something above centralization, above government something that should be the future of finance and the beginning of something new in every area of tech and any crypto company found to be engaged in such manipulation should be removed from Coinbase, Durafi, Binance, every exchange  you can name  because the very essence of Cryptocurrencies is contradictory to such actions.  


Do you share my beliefs and do you think crypto should be left outside politics and vice versa because I absolutely do."
"201","We are headed towards   recession, and this current situation in Ukraine is almost making it a certainty. How does this affect the crypto market you might ask ? Well no one knows because  during the last recession there was no such thing as a crypto market.   


Now my opinion is that this will be felt deeply in the crypto market because when people start worrying about having to put food on the table and gas in their cars the last thing on their minds will be tokens NFTs and currencies that could crash at any time, and especially in those countries that aren't In North America and west Europe.  


In my opinion a lot of people will sell off what currency they have in order to have cash on hand.   


For those of us who are fortunate enough not to worry about food and gas, I think we should stay in the game but diversify our funds to companies that also use blockchain technology but don't necessarily only have cryptocurrency but are engaged in other sectors of commerce like telecommunications, sustainable energy for example what WePower, PowerLedger, World Mobile Token, Telcoin just to name a few for you to  understand where I am going with this.  


Think about it, what makes crypto special is blockchain, and blockchain is the future for many sectors and not just a way to make BTC and other currencies and I believe that these other applications might be more recession proof.  


Do you share my sentiments, what are your opinions on this subject, is my reasoning correct ?"

I'm trying to rebalance a little and be a little more hands off. I have a few alts that have a lower P&amp;L than the likes of DOT, LINK etc. I'm confident my alts will survive the bear market but there's more room for downfall. 

I would be selling at a loss but also lowering overall loss % on more established coins.

What's your take on risk off?"
"203","There are various options for earning money that don't require you to put in constant work. Staking crypto is one method that has gained popularity and still continuing to do so, especially with the current market conditions.


I assume you agree on this one? What are your thoughts? I don't see any reason to disagree with, unless you have no experience with the crypto world and prefer banks.

Many platforms exist that will pay you a reasonable APY. Some prefer decentralized platforms, while others prefer centralised ones. Where you fit in is entirely up to you.

You might want to take a peek at these. It may or may not be known to you, but it may be useful in assisting you in switching platforms at your own risk.

1ã Coinbase 

It offers a simple staking solution for their staking-supported crypto on their exchange, with the added benefit of no minimum staking requirement, according to their article.

2ã Cryptocom

According to what I've read, Crypto com's mobile apps offer both flexible and fixed term staking with a few touches. Everyone has the opportunity to earn up to 14% APY. This platform is user-friendly, and even newbies will find it to be an ideal platform for crypto staking.

3ã Teneo Finance

Teneo allows holders to hold BTC, ETH, and other crypto assets while still earning from trading in the turbulent market, as long as those assets are minted into tenBTC, tenETH, and so on. (1 ETH is equivalent to 1tenETH etc).

The original assets are stored safely in the contract. I'm impressed on how Teneo's farming system works as they'll gradually reduce emissions as they attract capital. Investors should benefit from a low slippage switching opportunity at DEXs by rewarding tenXXX!

4ã Stake Fish
It's completely non-custodial staking service where they run public validator nodes on many crypto networks. This service has something in common with My container that also share masternode staking service. For me, it's pretty much unique way to earn.

5ã Ramp DeFi - I found out that you can earn yields while you borrow rUSD stablecoin.

You just need to mint stablecoin against your deposited assets and pursue new opportunities. They'll be rebranding in the coming months for a better change!

These are the few platforms I wanted to share with you based on my personal experience, but I'd also like to hear from you about which platforms are working for you. After all, we all desire a long-term platform from which we may gain and we can benefit from each other's experiences and contribution.

So please share your ideas and feel free to discuss any platforms that you believe are suitable for everyone."
"204","And I would add to this list any crypto company that flirts with politicians, and it goes without saying all of those that deal in pump and dump schemes. ( Of course it is almost impossible to tell which one is until it is to late ).  


Now insider trading in crypto is very simple, a company tells you they are planning an ICO you buy coins ahead of time when they launch and the value increases you take the dollar.  
This is destroying the purpose of crypto, and makes crypto currencies pretty much the same as any other any type of transaction or market sector that is prone to manipulation (stocks for example)  


The part with involving politicians in this is the most disgusting, they seek power everywhere and when crypto companies engage in such activities they lose their credibility, crypto is about trasparency, decentralization politics is about neither of those and I strongly believe that all companies found in bed with politicians should be delisted from Binance, Durafi, Coinbase you name it and sent to virtual purgatory for destroying the soul and essence of this idea.

"209","Its really frustrating to promise mass adoption on-chain then make people wait 8 hours for either stuck or failed transactions as soon as a good NFT project is minting or when a P2E gains wide popularity. And after the problems people had with Cosmos, Solana, and many others.

I think scaling optimistically will have a few issues, Optimism in its current state might get too expensive once serious activity hits the chain. So for the most part, I think ZK-Proofs will be the next big thing. Starknet and ZKSync sound extremely exciting, but I think the future will lean more towards L1s that have ZK-Proofs built in them. Polygon and Concordium are working towards this at the moment, but Polygon is yet to transition into its own L1 with the fear of a community turning against them for betraying the ETH maxis theyre siding with by choosing Ethereum as the settlement layer.

As this bear market hits, take the opportunity to see whats being in the works. Your voice as a community member in crypto matters; dont cheer for the earliest ICO date if the project sounds cool, demand more development, and most importantly, demand ultimate scalability so that your investment doesnt go from long to short term."
"210","Im all in for Ethereum and the decentralized ecosystem that comes along with it. However, Im also realistic and know that its not efficient nor sustainable enough to maintain larger and larger numbers and I think we already know that.

Even with the introduction of sharding, Ethereum will still be in massive need for scaling solutions. In fact Vitalik pressed on this topic a lot back in 2021 when he attended the Polygon Zk summit where he talked about the importance of accelerating scaling solutions and particularly ones that are ZK centric.

A lot of people think L2s and other scaling solutions will be obsolete but this is a huge misconception. In fact a lot of these scaling solutions will experience demand higher than ever and will most likely see pumps the upcoming years.

Im betting my money on Polygon cause Ethereum is heading in a more zero-knowledge path and Polygon has alloacted $1 billion just for that with more than 4 zk scaling solutions on their chain right noe.

I also think that Arbitrum might stand a chance as a competitor but they need to focus more on faster development cause theyve been very slow with that."

According to the report, the average reported loss for an individual was $2,600 in bitcoin, tether, or ether. According to the report, nearly half of the victims' thefts began with an ad, post, or message on a social media platform. While projects like Concordium have made transactions traceable by using iD recognition for transfers, such projects remain few and the inability to identify parties to crypto transactions has further led to the increase in crypto fraud.


Social media platforms are rife with cryptocurrency scams, which are frequently ""bogus investment opportunities."" This type of fraud resulted in a loss of $575 million. According to the report, cryptocurrencies account for more than a third of all social media fraud, far more than any other payment method.

Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram, are the most popular platforms for fraud, it was concluded.

Researchers discovered a bogus cryptocurrency exchange called BitVex less than a month ago, promising gullible investors a quick and easy way to double or triple their investments. To promote the scam, the fraudsters used a modified video of Elon Musk and promoted the campaign on various social media platforms, including YouTube. 

Elon Musk frequently tweets and talks about bitcoin and dogecoin, and as a result, his identity (opens in new tab) is almost constantly abused by cryptocurrency scammers.

The fraudsters often use this fear of missing out, to trick people into giving away their login credential, or connecting their wallets with fake projects and empty the contents as soon as they do."

Phase 4 speaks about the open economy of movement. Basically a way to reward everyone in amazing ways for any form of movement. Its going to include two key functions:

- Alternative Movement Validators

- Data analytics


1- Alternative Movement Validators: As the name implies sweat economy is looking any alternative means of how movements can be validated with this the economy becomes more decentralized, powerful and as well create more forms of movement (cycle, swim, do yoga, Pilates, or gym work).

The Movement Validators can offer users SWEAT for their movement, while earning SWEAT themselves. This is considered a win-win for the community

2- Data analytics: In Sweat Economy, you own the data you produce. Sweatcoin will never sell your data neither will sweat foundation but will help users monetize their own data IF they wish to.


In summary we all know that health data is important for some sectors to gain insights or improve a business model. Here the user gains because anyone who wants access to your data has to pay; the reward would return to you who contributed your data to the pool, while the DAO receives a fee for operating the service.


This and many more to read and understand from the [Sweat Economy tokenomices phase 4 ](https://medium.com/sweat-economy/sweat-the-tokenomics-phase-four-the-open-economy-of-movement-843d60962203)"

Development if a much more reliable indicator of how a market is heading rather than short term prices. And right now, theres a ton of development going on in the market honestly.

There are now giants like Apple and GameStop entering the crypto scene and making waves. That alone will bring tons of new blood to the market along with the fresh money.

Also, chains are starting to become a lot more sustainable which also means that adoption will become more and more prominent over the up coming years. Ethereum is moving over to PoS and new L1s like Concordium learned from the mistakes of Ethereum and implemented ZK proofs directly onto the chain for scaling it. Other chains like Cardano are also focusing on carbon negativity.

Lets also not forget that governments are starting to accept Bitcoin as legal tender and many companies and businesses are now accepting crypto payments as well.

I have been seeing more and more projects that use blockchain and crypto as the basis for their business models that have amazed me and that aren't just focusing on currencies but rather things like sustainable energy (WePower, PowerLedger) or telecommunication (World Mobile Token, Telcoin) with all of this being further proof that we will be seeing crypto and blockchain utilization more and more in business and tech companies.

"217","From crazy slippage to impermanent loss, we know AMMs suck.

Although AMMs were a massive first step for automatic permissionless trading, the end user experience was far from perfect. To this day, issues rarely seen in TradFi plague DeFi participants. However, a new model known as Proactive Market Making (PMM) is seeking to disrupt the industry.

PMMs attempt to anticipate market shifts and make adjustments in a non linear fashion. They account for the relationship between asset ratios, prices, order depth, etc. These new DEXs are able to generate much higher trading volumes at lower TVLs (Total Value Locked) while promising to create attractive LP incentives for their token holders.

*For example, with a TVL of only $32m, Dodo DEX has done almost a billion dollars in 30 day trading volume. While Uniswap has seen $1.5b in volume and Sushiswap has had 232m, their TVLs are 3.1x and 3.6x larger than Dodos, respectively.*

All of this is possible due to three main pillars that such decentralized exchanges are based on:  
**1 - Concentrated Liquidity**

Concentrated liquidity improves capital efficiency for LPs while minimizing slippage for traders. It adds depth to a market by providing capital in a limited price range, thereby improving capital efficiency according to a modified coefficient pricing curve.

**2 - Price Oracles**

Oracles do not rely on arbitrageurs to adjust prices. Therefore, putting them onto blockchains with high TPS (transactions per second) not only makes PMMs like Lifinity $LFNTY) possible, but malicious actions like front-running highly improbable. While chains like ETH with 15 - 20 TPS may not quite work for this, others like Avalanche or Solana do the trick. This model helps Lifinity make more profit market making through sheer speed.

With this said, Dodo Exchange is on Ethereum. This is because they price their assets primarily based on the balance of assets in their pool and then use the oracle price to adjust it. Therefore, TPS isnt as much of a priority here, but flexibility can still be maintained.

**3 - Rebalancing Mechanisms**

These ensure that pool balance regress to the pricing curve whenever a trade or price change occurs. Lets consider the pool USDC / ETH. At any given time, PMM is in one of three possible states:

* Equilibrium (ETH = USDC)
* Base token shortage (USDC &gt; ETH)
* Quote token shortage (ETH &lt; USDC).

Prior to any transaction, the capital pool is in equilibrium. As the pool is used we end up with four possible scenarios where either the base or quote token is sold to make up the difference.

Lets take a look at an FTM / USDC pool.

* (1) ETH price rises - ETH makes up more than 50% of the pool
* (2) ETH price falls - ETH makes up less than 50% of the pool
* (3) ETH price rises - ETH comprises less than 50% of the pool
* (4) ETH price falls - ETH makes up more than 50% of the pool

When a trader sells USDC, the FTM balance becomes higher than the USDC token regression target. In this state, the PMM will try to sell the excess FTM tokens in an attempt to decrease liquidity for buyers of FTM and increase liquidity for buyers of USDC.

In scenario 1 &amp; 2, the LP would benefit and the pool would sell the excess for a profit.

In scenario 3 &amp; 4, the LP would not benefit and liquidity would need to be adjusted.

This incentivizes traders to sell against the pool while discouraging them from buying, ensuring equilibrium is restored.

"220","I was just randomly browsing various things that led me through this [article](https://zycrypto.com/us-government-and-cryptocurrency-a-turbulent-relationship/) which inspired me to share my true feelings about this issue for the first time.  


Governments are doing everything they can to regulate or worse ban crypto and continue to criticize it because they are terrified of it. They will always demand their 'fair share'...and crypto was never theirs to begin with.

Crypto is, at its essence, a worldwide currency for all, with no centralized authority. It poses a threat to governments' control over money and wealth.

This is why more poor countries are beginning to accept cryptocurrency as legal currency. Crypto gives people freedom from their worthless currency and debt to wealthier nations.

Crypto has the potential to completely disrupt fiat and government currency.

It is truly the currency of the people, owned by the people, to be used by the people."
"221","As some backstory, I worked 48 hours a week and there are times I get severely stressed and there are times I get high fevers. Even if I am not feeling well, people at the company tell me to show up or don't bother coming in anymore. I didn't have a choice; I couldn't find another job, so I put up with it all because I needed to pay my bills and eat.

That job was a mental nightmare for me every day. The whole company itself is toxic. Before I resigned, I made sure I had enough and invested some crypto and stocks and mutual funds. Fast forward today I found a better high paying job that was loads better than my previous job. Not only that, my crypto earnings had increased even better than my stocks and mutual funds.

With crypto, I want to secure myself and my family with pride. I never want to be in a situation where I have no choice but to put up with anything, and I'm hoping that crypto can help me with that. I also want to invest long term and make sure I dont get emotional with the roller coaster ride with all the dips that have been happening in various cryptos. I was an early investor and fortunately it didn't affect me.

I admit there are times where there my thoughts are divided between HODLING or Staking my crypto with [defi protocols](https://app.aave.com/) and/or [crypto staking platforms](https://haruinvest.com/) till I'm confident to rely on my earnings, as well as whatever my future family will be OR selling it off because of the dip (and the news about LUNA) and start living a luxurious life showing off my nice house and new car but I learned that not letting people know your ups and downs of financial status is a lot better.

I'm attempting to train myself to work smarter rather than harder. I just want to get out of this cycle of poverty where I spend the majority of my income on bills, food and the endless cycle of living from paycheck to paycheck."
"222","DOT's Layer zero design makes it one of the best and I'm excited to see what the future holds for the evolution of zero-knowledge technologies and the Polkadot infrastructure as a whole.However, we must keep in mind that the success/thrive of the Dot system as a whole is dependent on the quality of the parachains and their overall adoption.  


I think that the nature of Polkadot space teaches people that cooperation and community is more important just like what they did [here](https://bitcoinist.com/polkadot-pioneers-prize-names-manta-network-the-architect-open-division-competition-advancing-zero-knowledge-technology/). They are uniting projects for a common goal and that is to bring the opportunities of blockchain to the world."
"223","Polkadot enables cross-chain security rather than requiring it of network users. That is its primary, defining, and distinguishing feature.

Its technique to deal with the decentralized problem is great.

There is no other project that can compete with what Polkadot has created.

Polkadot's utility and functions provide us with something no one else can. They ensure that multi-chain networks are kept secure while not compromising decentralization.

The polkadot architecture and parachains are great. Personally, I believe it will bring functionality and utility. I'm also looking forward to the release of the XCM. When I read [this](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/24/social-media-disruptor-project-liberty-to-run-on-polkadots-blockchain-network/), I got even more intrigued as this could be a very good service for everyone in the Polkadot ecosystem and Web 3 in general.

I like DOT, but I hope they get some non-engineers to chime in on the UX because it appears to be designed by and for engineers, which I believe is a big problem."
"225","If you've been following cryptocurrencies for a while, you'll notice that most of us don't pay much attention to exchanges other than the ones we use on a regular basis.

This piqued my curiosity because the interactions and expenses of my present transactions are increasing.

I currently use Kucoin, bitvavo, and binance.

However, as I read on several crypto subs. I became interested in trying [Gemini](https://twitter.com/Gemini) because they offer crypto learning tools and a wide variety of supported cryptocurrencies. I also came across AAX and became intrigued when I read their [blog](https://blog.aax.com/en/2022/05/31/aax-unveils-aaxcel-to-enable-crypto-community-to-vote-for-its-preferred-projects/), hoping to contribute and join their community to vote for my favorite crypto projects.

Is it a good idea to try a different exchange this time?While we have considered only a few platforms that exist on the market, what platforms do you already use among mentioned or just planning to try?"
"226","A new collaboration between major global restaurant software and payments solution provider Lavu and Fintech payments firm Verifone is set to allow thousands of restaurants in 65 countries to accept several cryptos as a payment method.

"227","""All five of South Koreas licensed, fiat-trading crypto exchanges have announced they will delist [Litecoin (LTC)](https://swapzone.io/currencies/litecoin)  after developers rolled out the Mimblewimble Extension Block protocol"". 

According to Cryptonews.com Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax decided to delist LTC. It's the first time for the South Korean crypto industry that all major exchangers made such a decision. 

In Upbits statement, which was similar to those of its rivals, the exchange said that transaction support would last until June 20, with withdrawals allowed until July 20. 

Last month, the protocol, which allows users of the Litecoin network to choose whether or not to make their transactions confidential, was presented. According to exchanges this update broke South Korean law which forbids exchanges from listing such tokens, insisting that all transactions be screened for possible money laundering violations.

Is it the end for LTC?

"228","Blockchain technology has been in use for some time now. The development of blockchain solutions using a regulatory approach to enable greater adoption of security tokens has been a much heated debate over whether it will survive or not. Tokenized securities have to comply with legal regulations like conventional securities law. Regulatory oversight combined with blockchain provides enhanced transparency and greater investor protection.

An STO is a process of issuing a tokenized security, which is the digital representation of a security asset in the form of a digital token on a blockchain platform such as asset-based tokens, representing ownership of an asset like real estate. STOs can increase both the demand and supply side of investments. On the demand side, the enhanced transparency features of blockchain can further increase investor confidence.

I am of a similar view to some in the RE industry that tokenization reduces investor risk and can be scaled to a sufficient size to allow investors with liquidity constraints to participate(small investors like myself). An important feature of the blockchain architecture is disintermediation, now almost anyone can directly and transparently interact without the need for a central authority. Because compliance is built into the core of the Polymesh blockchain, issuers and investors benefit from faster processing and lower protocol fees 

Real estate is regarded as one of the safest kinds of investments, with the highest returns, the average individual may struggle their entire life just to own a home much less invest in an apartment or commercial property, and with tokenization, the landscape may begin to become more level. Real estate tokenization has become easier and will continue to, especially with polymath technology involved in the process.

I hope I am not wrong on this one but tokenized real estate will be the next big money maker for a lot more people. As the technology gets clearer and more the complexities are streamlined we will soon see the door pushed wide open by more industries looking to come in. Given that the entire point of blockchain tech is decentralized, I struggle to see tokenization without some kind of centralization and I foresee nearly all crypto ending at this same spot?

What are your thoughts on this one?"
"229","Hey everyone, sorry if this has been discussed already, but Ive been staking with CDC for as long as I can remember, I'm not an active investor in Crypto and I prefer to stake it in exchanges that make a decent APY (Not protocols). Initially, I was staking USDC and received around 12% APR, as my 3-month term comes to an end, it will change to 6%.

Ive been looking around for other exchanges to safely move my money into. Regarding high APYs, I know [NAGAX](https://invezz.com/news/2022/05/26/nagax-a-crypto-trading-platform-rolls-out-multi-coin-staking-feature/) recently launched their staking service with NGC, [Nexo](https://twitter.com/Nexo) still has high rates, and Celsius has decent percentages.

"230","We often take our data for granted but the reality is that data is one of the most valuable sources of revenue that a company can get its hands on.

Advertisement companies are willing to pay hundreds of millions to get insights on the populous preferences and spending habits in order to know exactly how, when and where to target them with ads.

This is the bread and butter of many major companies of the world most notably Facebook and Google and these companies dont want to give people control over their own data cause it would be detrimental to their revenue stream.

But with crypto all our data is being encrypted meaning we have full control over how we can use it. And were already starting to see some projects surfacing that are giving people the option to monetize their data kinda like what Ocean Protocol has been doing recently. Although theyve only been doing this for scientific related purposes but I believe that this could easily be expanded.

Its no wonder than these major companies are starting to tao into the crypto market. At first they actually fought crypto but quickly realized that they cant stop it. And you that famous saying if you cant beat em, join em"
