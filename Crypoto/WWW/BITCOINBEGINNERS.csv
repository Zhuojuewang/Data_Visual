"1","Hello team! I tried searching for this answer but was not getting a clear response&

Im in the US, want to set a limit buy order and pay the lowest fees possible. I also need to be able to move the Bitcoin off line after it clears. Whats my best option? Coin base pro? Currently Im using Strike and FTX to buy but Im feeling like a slave constantly checking prices waiting to buy at my price target.

Any help will be highly appreciated."
"3","Hello, I'm trying to see where my coins went.

If I have a crypto address, is there a way of ascertaining if it  belongs to a cryptocurrency exchange? 

I had sent my coins to an exchange a while ago and they were moved to an address that is unknown. 

I would like to know if said address belonged to an exchange I may have sent it to.

Things to know:

The exchange in the form that I had sent it to doesn't exist; this is an issue I am dealing with separately, aid on that front is pending. 

If anyone can help me that could be great.

Does T stanf for Trillion of Hashes (necessary, on average, to find a ""winning"" Hash) ?

If yes, knowing that the Bitcoin Network Hashrate is actualy  around 280 EH/s, this doesn't seem to add up for the 10 min average to find a block.

So I am now about to preorder my raspberry pi kit however&

I am trying to understand the concept behind the decision making that I can participate in once I run a full node.

So I came across taproot, BSV BCash&

In relation to these, is it correct for me to say that these changes happened or implemented because the nodes agreed to them right?

I mean for BSV and Bcash they became forks because some nodes agree and some didnt right? From what I read some peoples bitcoin were converted to those two without their consent. 

But if I have my own node, I can prevent this from happening to my bitcoin? Is that right? 

I am scared because it feels intimidating to buy a node. Like I am overthinking if I run the node I will just click the wrong things on screen and agree to another fork or something=

For taproot, is my understanding correct that taproot is implemented because the majority nodes also agreed to this upgrade right?

mining or non mining node can both participate in the decision making right? Or do miners have more power? (Not sure how to phrase that=)

Does the centralized exchange have a finite capacity to provide leverage to traders based on the exchange's own available treasury funds?

A trader who places a $100MM trade at 20x leverage ($2B total) would require Binance to front the leveraged amount?

I just learned about the ""discount"" with Grayscale's btc trust. The price is significantly less than btc itself right now. 

If their trust gets converted to a Spot ETF, I would instantly get like 25% growth on my investment. I also wouldn't have to keep custody of my own btc. That has always worried me a bit. 

I realize the conversion may not happen for years and I'd have to pay 2% per year in fees in the meantime. But as long as it gets converted within the next 12 years, I'd make a profit.

"51","What would happen to a coin if it were declared a security?"
"52","Quote: ""How can bitcoin not be controlled? If one person can buy so much, they can artificially change its value.""

So I answered them:

""While you are correct that the price of Bitcoin can be manipulated, unfortunately that is something that exists in an open market. Billion dollar hedge-funds or asset managers indeed take advantage of THIS. They can move markets and cause people with weak hands to panic and sell thereby driving the price down even further etc. Or the other way round and cause people to FOMO into it.

However, to answer your question of how can bitcoin not be controlled; if one understands Bitcoin, then one understands that the Bitcoin network achieves digital  scarcity for its BTC payment system. You cannot duplicate or double-spend your BTC.

The reason this is important is because as Bitcoin continues to grow (for 13 years already) and gain worldwide adoption, people don't just hold it on exchanges and they start withdrawing it from there. They use it on their own wallet. That means the exchanges actually need to have the Bitcoin. Otherwise, nobody would trust them.

Why is this important? Because as people withdraw, the exchanges have to actually go and buy more Bitcoins on the open market. That drives the price up (hence digital scarcity).

This is the main reason Bitcoin has been able to grow in price consistently ever since its inception.

This is so important to understand because the US government has been manipulating the price of Gold via rehypothecation.

The US sells paper-gold on the open markets. This paper gold is an IOU. It's not real gold. So when gold becomes valuable due to high demand (I. E. When the US dollar weakens and inflation is high), the US sells paper-gold on the open market to drive its price down and keep it down. The US does not want the world to see Gold as a store of value over the US dollar.

So the US plays God and controls the supply and demand of a supposedly 'free' market to maintain its dollar status of the world reserve currency.

The US cannot do this to Bitcoin. Although exchanges do engage in this fractional reserve system where they don't hold as much Bitcoin as people actually have on their exchange, they are limited as to how much they can do this. They do not want to risk a scenario where they are short Bitcoins and they experience a 'bank run'. Just image, Binance or Coinbase not letting their customers withdraw Bitcoins. They are so big and rich and they do not want to risk this.

I hope this gives you some clarity as to how much Bitcoin can be controlled.

Please feel free to follow up with more questions."""

"58","True or false: having a consensus mechanism that is impacted by economies of scale (PoW) is inherently centralizing because it will become unprofitable for the long-tail to participate in consensus and the mining power will concentrate with the largest industrial operators. It is also affected by regulation and governments can shut off Bitcoin mining by pulling external levers such as taxes, electricity costs, and outright bans on crypto mining. BTC is not resistant to this because it costs an immense amount to setup a mining facility that can meaningfully participate in consensus. Even if enough individuals operate miners, how can you ensure the steady operation of these miners into the future?

"65","Can anyone help me get a more comprehensive understanding of the below questions? Ive read all the basic normal stuff, but still dont really get how it works exactly:

&amp;#x200B;

1.Does the ledger hardware wallet or the live ledger app create the wallet address? It should be the hardware wallet right? Im assuming this is what the coin app on the wallet does, right? And then the hardware wallet shares the address with the live app, right?

2. The live app is not needed to keep installed on my phone correct? Im just holding and regardless if i uninstall the app or get a new phone and reinstall the app on that phone, or just use my computer in the future. The live app just syncs with the hardware wallet. And i dont need to keep anything from the app, correct?

3. If the live app isnt actually doing anything except acting as a interface into the hardware wallet. Is it getting the balance data (how much btc i have) just from the last sync with the hardware wallet? So if have my balance on my wallet that i used the phone app to transfer into it. Then connect the hardware wallet to my computer and transferred some btc away to a friend. The phone app would still display the old balance right? Or would it know, not because it had access to the btc. But because its keeping an eye on the address on the block chain?

4. If someone were to get my hardware wallet, all they need to do is crack my pin to access my funds right? Since the live ledger app doesnt actually have anything related to access my funds and doesnt do anything except serve as a interface. correct?

5. I seriously dont get the whole 24 pass phrase thing. How exactly does this phrase or the phrase for electrum, or what ever wallet. Actually connect to the blockchain and enable this location on the chain to be enabled. Like what is enabling or authorizing wallets like ledger or electrum to have access to the chain?

6. How is the ledger wallet able to use one 24 pass phrase for multiple block chains?

7. If i lose my ledger: This is a security risk if i dont generate a new 24 phrase correct? All someone needs to do is crack my pin. So do i essentially have to: recover the phrase on new ledger, send funds to my kraken account wallet, wipe the new ledger and generate NEW 24 phrase, send the funds from kraken to new ledger?"

&amp;#x200B;

I've a question, It is advisable to use a bitcoin address only once to receive funds. This to preserve its security and avoid any system of cryptanalysis and detection of our identity (correct me if I'm wrong).

However, is this really the case in practice? Is the address really single-use?

Does the protocol still allow reusing an address, or is it a good security practice to take only ?

In addition, I have a sub-question, in the case of an automatic creation of a BASE58(P2PKH) address via Electrum (let's imagine), this is archived as soon as the funds are received, or when the funds are released after validation any related scriptpubkey? In this case, it means that while the utxo is not spent (and therefore the public key is not revealed in the clear in the scriptsig), the bitcoin address can be reused, right? since no one knows the public key yet...

Example, cdc chart shows 26.1k on BTC and my sale order shows 25.6k. Same time..

Also another question. Since CDC chart is $400 above kucoin and binance, if I transfer BTC to kucoin or binance, would my balance of BTC be larger then my balance on cdc since the coin is cheaper on the other exchanges?

"75","Hey all,

I am interested in taking a deeper dive into Bitcoin and especially the Lightning Network. I figured running a node at some capacity would be a great learning experience and plus self hosting is better for security I heard. To give a sense of where I'm at, I use a Trezor to store/transact my sats but got no electrum or self hosted connection.

I am looking at **running both a Bitcoin and Lightning node**. I plan on dual booting Windows and Ubuntu and using the latter for the node. **It would be on a hard drive and no wired ethernet connection** for my PC, which leads me to going the pruned route so I don't have to wait 2 months for the blockchain to download...

**It appears I can do some finagling with** **Umbrel to have a pruned node or use a light client service like Neutrino**. I am aware the purest and most secure option is to have a full node but really this is more of a learning experience so I am fine with running a light client node.

**Anyways just curious to hear advice when it comes to self hosting with more limited setups**. I guess I could go crazy and get a raspberry pi but I'd rather work with what I already got, which is essentially a 5 yr old gaming PC I am looking to repurpose as I can't run many games on it anymore.

My questions are about record keeping and taxation.  


**Technically**  If I load $100 from my cold storage onto Muun on the main chain, then used the lightning network to send $10 to 10 people, should I technically be reporting to a tax office that I disposed of the asset? If so, how do you go about making sure you keep track of this kind of stuff / the values of bitcoin at the time in dollars.  


**Practically**  On the lightning network is it even auditable/traceable to the point where a tax office would be able to see that I disposed of the asset / used lightning to give away bitcoin for free? It's for such small amounts that I really can't be fucked. I'm interested in the answer though."

"97","Hey all, been buying bitcoin in $25-$100 increments sporadically for the past couple years, and up until recently I would always buy them on Robinhood without a second thought. I've slowly realized (after listening to Lex Friedman's podcast with the guy who wrote Bitcoin Standard and thinking about it some more) that I should probably figure something else out to where I actually own my bitcoin. However, I've been busy the past few weeks and when I have sat down and tried to find out where to buy outside of an exchange, it seemed a lot more complicated than I figured it would be (which I guess is the value of going through an exchange).

I still want to sit down one of these days and figure out how to buy my bitcoin to actually own it, but since the price is so ungodly low, I was wondering if stopping investment in bitcoin altogether on Robinhood in this interim between an exchange and actual ownership is the best of ideas? Wouldn't I be able to just sell the coins I have on Robinhood and then buy them back on whatever I end up settling into? 

Thanks, from a crypto noob.

P.S. My first thought was to go with [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) or coinbase, but I read some horror stories and also figured it would be sort of similar where I don't actually own the coins. Feel free to tell me if I'm wrong and these are actually decent options."

"101","Hi all,

Apologies if this isn't the right forum to ask such a question or if it has been answered before but I was hoping someone smarter than I could give an ELI5 explanation of some questions i had in relation to mining.

I have purely an academic interest and want to be able to explain the concept in simple terms and have found many useful videos and sources on youtube and on the wider web explaining the process of mining, why and how it works. So I (think) i have a functional grasp of the process and concept but my questions are more related to the practical real world side of mining.

For example:

I understand that mining is the process of validating a block of transactions by solving the hash for that block- once a hash is solved the miner is rewarded with an allocation of newly minted BTC (6.25 as i understand) as well as the transaction fees from that block- my question in relation to this are as follows:

a) is it only the computer that solves the hash that is allocated that reward? If so, how are rewards allocated in a mining pool where  multiple actors are combining computing resources?

b) If someone was a solo miner, and they weren't lucky enough to solve a hash for a block, do they receive any reward at all? If so, from where? I have seen videos from several solo miners who appear to be mining a consistent amount of BTC per day, say 0.01 BTC- where is this coming from if they werent the computer to solve the hash?

c) Over time i understand BTC mining will become more and more challenging, as it will be more challenging to solve the hash to verify a new block- however even as the difficulty grows the block time is still to be 10 minutes- how does that work?

I would be most grateful for any answers to my questions or pointers to resources as I am finding it difficult to find clear answers to the questions I have- also happy to be corrected on any flaws in my understanding :)

Many Thanks"

Hodlhodl also looked like a viable option but my understanding is that you need a VPN to use it in the states, and I'd rather do this as legitimately as I can. Last one I've looked into a decent bit is mycelium, which could work, but the only seller nearby has a markup of about 12% (relative to the current BTC value that Google shows at least), and it's not clear to me what the miner fee would be like since as far as I can tell the app itself doesn't show that to buyers in advance, and idk how I could have a decent estimate beyond just trusting the various numbers mentioned on different sites.

      * The HW wallet at your home can not send funds alone  


  


* **Single HW wallet**  

   * You set up wallet with seed phrase and passphrase  

      * The passphrase being required to spend in commination with the HW wallet or with the seed phrase is the weakness... so you must double back up the passphrase (or otherwise lose everything)
   * Site Plan (non of these sites can be your home!)  

      * Site 1 - offsite #1 (HW wallet)
      * Site 2 - offsite #2 (seed steel backup)
      * Site 3 - offsite #3 (passphrase on steel)
      * Site 4 - offsite #4 (passphrase on steel)
      * *Site 5 - soft site.... memorize passphrase*
   * Use  

      * You have the passphrase in your head *(soft site 5)*. You need to drive to site 1 or site 2 to get the HW wallet or seed phrase to spend (this still provides protection from $5 wrench attack)
      * You forget the passphrase --&gt; You have to drive to site 1 or site 2 to get the seed or HW wallet, then to Site 3 or Site 4 to get the passphrase
      * Site 3 or Site 4 is destroyed ... you can go and retrieve the surviving passphrase then go to site 1 or site 2 to spend

  


Final Thoughts:

1. While the single HW wallet scenario requires an extra site for a hard passphrase backup; it allows the user to not have to worry about maintaining a copy of all 3 sets of xPubs and lowers set up complexity of vault  

   1. It still takes a trip to spend *(at least one trip)*
2. In the single HW wallet scenario the user could use an encrypted password manager for site 3 or site 4. While lowering security, I think it's still reasonable since the thief would have to be sophisticated enough to hack your password manager and find either site 1 or site 2 which would be off your home premises.
3. The brute force security would be less on the single HW wallet case.... since you'd *'only'* have to brute force the 12 word seed and 5-6 word passphrase....  

   1. In the multi sig scenario, I think you'd have to brute force two 12 word seeds... and maybe have access to all 3 xPubs? This seems harder.."

He did touch on this briefly when discussing other things that came first and continue to thrive because everyone uses them (e.g. email POP protocol) even though somebody could theoretically create something new and/or better.

Yesterday my Trust Wallet app crashed, upon trying to make a coin transfer, and the next thing I know when I open the app again is my wallets are gone.

I know I should have written off my phrases, but I'm hoping I can do either one of two things, and I'll explain why I think it's possible later:

"" Temper the app data so it can read the previous state and my wallets are visible to me again.
"" Find and decrypt the seed phrases from the app data

The reason why I think this is possible is because I'm on a rooted Android. So whenever I was using the app it would warn me about the risk of applications or attackers with root permission accessing my wallets info and seed phrases. By the same principle I think it's possible for me to access these files. The thing is I don't quite have the knowledge required for that.

"211","Noob still picking it up. In the process of opening a couple of accounts and I do have a hardware wallet. Not planning any illegal activities or depositing millions of dollars, just trying to completely understand how things work.   
Purchasing from an exchange they have all your info and you need to link a bank account so your bank also has everything. Every penny in and out is documented.

Havent tried one yet but using an ATM is mentioned a lot. From what I have seen even these require some ID. One I just looked at requires a registered account for over $250. Under that amount you still need a phone number. Easily traced back to you. Of course I guess you could use a burner phone but for small amounts that makes no sense.

Other than person to person and handing over cash is there really any way to do it?

Of course you would then have to eliminate that person because they know what you just received.

"231","**TL;DR: How can blockchain nodes communicate to tell each other to update the ledger without the use of a centralized server?**

Hi everyone,

Im a bit of a bitcoin noob, so correct me if anything I say here doesnt make sense or is just completely wrong.

Im interested primarily in blockchains and decentralization in general. As part of my research on blockchains, the concept of keeping decentralized ledgers eluded me.

Mainly, Im wondering how each node in the blockchain receives a new copy of the ledger to validate. Wouldnt they need

A) a central ledger to grab and validate locally

Or

B) some sort of communication protocol (which would mean a server storing connected nodes).

Im sure Im missing something really simple, like I said, Im an absolute beginner in all of this. Any expert out there that can help?"

&amp;#x200B;

Another beginner's question! Thanks especially for your time.

I am trying to understand this notion of P2SH transaction.

For the P2PKH it's perfect I understand.

But what I don't understand is when I'm told that a P2SH transaction can be composed in its redeem script of any standard pubkey script except P2SH itself.

This means that the redeem script of a P2SH transaction may contain a ""P2PKH pkscript"" composed of: OP\_DUP, OP\_HASH160, &lt;hash160(pubkey)&gt;, OP\_EQUALVERIFY, OP\_CHECKSIG?

But in this case, (and if I'm not mistaken), how does the redeem script get processed without having the &lt;hash160(pubkey)&gt; reserved for a BTC address?

I don't know if I'm very clear,

OK, I'm a bit confused, anyone have an idea?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your help !"

"241","Hey everyone, Im looking at getting a hardware wallet soon. It must be BTC only, air gapped, and extremely secure. Ive narrowed my choices down to Foundation Passport, Cold Card, and Keystone Pro (running as BTC only). Whats everyones thoughts on these? I see Cold Card talked about the most out of all three. Im curious everyones thoughts on all three though. Ive mainly got my eyes on the Passport and Cold Card. Whatever I get Im wanting to connect to my Umbrel node and likely Sparrow. I really like with the Keystone and Passport the ability to use QR codes, the detachable batteries, and the UI and displays. Cold Card has a lot more security features I like such as the duress pin / wallet, brick me pin, etc. It seems Keystone has a few of these features, but from what I can tell the Passport Batch 2 doesnt have these. If it does someone correct me cause itd make me more likely to buy it. Whats everyones thoughts and experiences?"
